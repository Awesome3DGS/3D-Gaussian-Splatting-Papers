### Bridging 3D Gaussian and Mesh for Freeview Video Rendering

This is only a preview version of GauMesh. Recently, primitive-based rendering has been proven to achieve convincing results in solving the problem of modeling and rendering the 3D dynamic scene from 2D images. Despite this, in the context of novel view synthesis, each type of primitive has its inherent defects in terms of representation ability. It is difficult to exploit the mesh to depict the fuzzy geometry. Meanwhile, the point-based splatting (e.g. the 3D Gaussian Splatting) method usually produces artifacts or blurry pixels in the area with smooth geometry and sharp textures. As a result, it is difficult, even not impossible, to represent the complex and dynamic scene with a single type of primitive. To this end, we propose a novel approach, GauMesh, to bridge the 3D Gaussian and Mesh for modeling and rendering the dynamic scenes. Given a sequence of tracked mesh as initialization, our goal is to simultaneously optimize the mesh geometry, color texture, opacity maps, a set of 3D Gaussians, and the deformation field. At a specific time, we perform α-blending on the RGB and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffers from mesh and 3D Gaussian rasterizations. This produces the final rendering, which is supervised by the ground-truth image. Experiments demonstrate that our approach adapts the appropriate type of primitives to represent the different parts of the dynamic scene and outperforms all the baseline methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons without losing render speed.

这只是GauMesh的预览版本。最近，基于原始图元的渲染在解决从2D图像建模和渲染3D动态场景的问题中已被证明能够取得令人信服的结果。尽管如此，在新视角合成的上下文中，每种类型的图元在表示能力方面都有其固有的缺陷。利用网格描述模糊的几何形状是困难的。同时，基于点的平滑（例如3D高斯平滑）方法通常在具有平滑几何和锐利纹理的区域产生伪影或模糊像素。因此，用单一类型的图元来表示复杂和动态的场景是困难的，甚至是不可能的。为此，我们提出了一种新的方法，GauMesh，以桥接3D高斯和网格，用于建模和渲染动态场景。给定一系列跟踪的网格作为初始化，我们的目标是同时优化网格几何、颜色纹理、不透明度映射、一组3D高斯和变形场。在特定时间，我们根据从网格和3D高斯光栅化合并和重新排序的z缓冲区，对RGB和不透明度值进行α混合。这产生了最终渲染，该渲染由真实图像监督。实验表明，我们的方法适应不同类型的图元来表示动态场景的不同部分，并在定量和定性比较中超越所有基线方法，而不会损失渲染速度。
