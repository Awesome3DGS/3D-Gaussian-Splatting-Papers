### SuperGS: Consistent and Detailed 3D Super-Resolution Scene Reconstruction via Gaussian Splatting

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has excelled in novel view synthesis (NVS) with its real-time rendering capabilities and superior quality. However, it encounters challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due to the coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To address this issue, we propose SuperGS, an expansion of Scaffold-GS designed with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In the low-resolution stage, we introduce a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution scene, which serves as both the initialization and foundational information for super-resolution optimization. In the high-resolution stage, we propose a multi-view consistent densification strategy that backprojects high-resolution depth maps based on error maps and employs a multi-view voting mechanism, mitigating ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo labels provided by 2D prior models while avoiding Gaussian redundancy. Furthermore, we model uncertainty through variational feature learning and use it to guide further scene representation refinement and adjust the supervisory effect of pseudo-labels, ensuring consistent and detailed scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS outperforms state-of-the-art HRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets.

近年来，三维高斯散点（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）在新视角合成（Novel View Synthesis, NVS）任务中表现出色，凭借其实时渲染能力与卓越的图像质量受到广泛关注。然而，当面对高分辨率新视角合成（High-Resolution Novel View Synthesis, HRNVS）时，3DGS 由于其基元通常源自低分辨率输入视图而显得过于粗糙，难以胜任高保真渲染任务。
为解决这一问题，我们提出了 SuperGS，这是对 Scaffold-GS 的扩展，采用了一个双阶段的粗到细训练框架。在低分辨率阶段，我们引入了潜在特征场（latent feature field）来表示低分辨率场景，它既作为高分辨率优化的初始化，又提供基础信息支持后续超分辨率建模。
在高分辨率阶段，我们提出了一种多视角一致性的稠密化策略，通过误差图回投高分辨率深度图，并引入多视角投票机制，以缓解多视角伪标签之间的不一致性带来的歧义，同时避免冗余高斯点的引入。
此外，我们通过变分特征学习（variational feature learning）对不确定性建模，并据此引导后续的场景表示优化过程，同时动态调整伪标签的监督权重，从而确保最终的场景重建既一致又细致。
大量实验结果表明，SuperGS 在 forward-facing 和 360 度数据集上均显著优于现有最先进的 HRNVS 方法。
