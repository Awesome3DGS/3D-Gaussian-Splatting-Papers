### SA-GS: Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting for Training-Free Anti-Aliasing

In this paper, we present a Scale-adaptive method for Anti-aliasing Gaussian Splatting (SA-GS). While the state-of-the-art method Mip-Splatting needs modifying the training procedure of Gaussian splatting, our method functions at test-time and is training-free. Specifically, SA-GS can be applied to any pretrained Gaussian splatting field as a plugin to significantly improve the field's anti-alising performance. The core technique is to apply 2D scale-adaptive filters to each Gaussian during test time. As pointed out by Mip-Splatting, observing Gaussians at different frequencies leads to mismatches between the Gaussian scales during training and testing. Mip-Splatting resolves this issue using 3D smoothing and 2D Mip filters, which are unfortunately not aware of testing frequency. In this work, we show that a 2D scale-adaptive filter that is informed of testing frequency can effectively match the Gaussian scale, thus making the Gaussian primitive distribution remain consistent across different testing frequencies. When scale inconsistency is eliminated, sampling rates smaller than the scene frequency result in conventional jaggedness, and we propose to integrate the projected 2D Gaussian within each pixel during testing. This integration is actually a limiting case of super-sampling, which significantly improves anti-aliasing performance over vanilla Gaussian Splatting. Through extensive experiments using various settings and both bounded and unbounded scenes, we show SA-GS performs comparably with or better than Mip-Splatting. Note that super-sampling and integration are only effective when our scale-adaptive filtering is activated.

在本文中，我们提出了一种适应尺度的抗锯齿高斯喷溅方法（SA-GS）。虽然最先进的方法Mip-Splatting需要修改高斯喷溅的训练程序，但我们的方法在测试时运行且无需训练。具体来说，SA-GS可以作为插件应用于任何预训练的高斯喷溅场，显著提高场的抗锯齿性能。核心技术是在测试时对每个高斯应用2D适应尺度的滤波器。如Mip-Splatting所指出的，观察不同频率的高斯导致训练和测试期间高斯尺度的不匹配。Mip-Splatting通过使用3D平滑和2D Mip滤波器来解决这个问题，不幸的是，这些滤波器不知道测试频率。在这项工作中，我们展示了一个知道测试频率的2D适应尺度滤波器可以有效地匹配高斯尺度，从而使高斯原始分布在不同测试频率下保持一致。当消除了尺度不一致性时，小于场景频率的采样率会导致传统的锯齿状，我们建议在测试中对每个像素内的投影2D高斯进行积分。这种积分实际上是超采样的一种极限情况，显著提高了抗锯齿性能，超过了原始高斯喷溅。通过使用各种设置以及有界和无界场景进行广泛的实验，我们展示了SA-GS的性能与Mip-Splatting相当或更好。注意，超采样和积分仅在我们的适应尺度滤波启用时有效。
