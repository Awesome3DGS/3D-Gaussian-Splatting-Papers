### GaussianHair: Hair Modeling and Rendering with Light-aware Gaussians

Hairstyle reflects culture and ethnicity at first glance. In the digital era, various realistic human hairstyles are also critical to high-fidelity digital human assets for beauty and inclusivity. Yet, realistic hair modeling and real-time rendering for animation is a formidable challenge due to its sheer number of strands, complicated structures of geometry, and sophisticated interaction with light. This paper presents GaussianHair, a novel explicit hair representation. It enables comprehensive modeling of hair geometry and appearance from images, fostering innovative illumination effects and dynamic animation capabilities. At the heart of GaussianHair is the novel concept of representing each hair strand as a sequence of connected cylindrical 3D Gaussian primitives. This approach not only retains the hair's geometric structure and appearance but also allows for efficient rasterization onto a 2D image plane, facilitating differentiable volumetric rendering. We further enhance this model with the "GaussianHair Scattering Model", adept at recreating the slender structure of hair strands and accurately capturing their local diffuse color in uniform lighting. Through extensive experiments, we substantiate that GaussianHair achieves breakthroughs in both geometric and appearance fidelity, transcending the limitations encountered in state-of-the-art methods for hair reconstruction. Beyond representation, GaussianHair extends to support editing, relighting, and dynamic rendering of hair, offering seamless integration with conventional CG pipeline workflows. Complementing these advancements, we have compiled an extensive dataset of real human hair, each with meticulously detailed strand geometry, to propel further research in this field.

发型首先反映了文化和种族。在数字时代，各种逼真的人类发型对于高保真度的数字人类资产也至关重要，这关乎美感和包容性。然而，由于发丝数量庞大、几何结构复杂以及与光的复杂相互作用，逼真的头发建模和动画的实时渲染是一个巨大的挑战。本文介绍了一种新颖的显式头发表示方法 GaussianHair。它能够从图像中全面建模头发的几何形状和外观，促进创新的照明效果和动态动画能力的发展。GaussianHair的核心是一个新颖的概念，即将每一根头发丝表示为一系列连接的圆柱形3D高斯原始体。这种方法不仅保留了头发的几何结构和外观，还允许高效地光栅化到2D图像平面上，便于不同的体积渲染。我们进一步增强了这个模型，通过“GaussianHair散射模型”，能够熟练地重现头发丝的细长结构，并在均匀光照下准确捕捉它们的局部漫反射颜色。通过广泛的实验，我们证明了GaussianHair在几何和外观保真度方面都取得了突破性进展，超越了当前最先进方法在头发重建方面遇到的限制。超越表示之外，GaussianHair还支持编辑、重新照明和动态渲染头发，提供了与传统CG流程工作流的无缝集成。为了进一步推动这一领域的研究，我们还编纂了一个包含真实人类头发的广泛数据集，每个数据集都有精心详细的头发丝几何结构。
