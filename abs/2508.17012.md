### Fiducial Marker Splatting for High-Fidelity Robotics Simulations

High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting (GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world applications.

高保真三维模拟对移动机器人训练至关重要，但其传统依赖的基于网格的表示在复杂环境中往往表现不佳，例如在充满遮挡和重复结构的密集温室中。近期的神经渲染方法（如高斯溅射，GS）能够实现令人瞩目的视觉真实感，但缺乏灵活性来融入用于机器人定位与控制的标志物。为此，我们提出了一种混合框架，将 GS 的逼真效果与结构化标志物表示相结合。我们的核心贡献是一种新颖算法，能够在杂乱场景中高效生成基于 GS 的标志物（如 AprilTags）。实验结果表明，该方法在效率和位姿估计精度方面均优于传统的图像拟合技术。我们进一步在温室模拟中展示了该框架的潜力。这一农业场景是一个具有挑战性的测试平台，其密集的植被、相似的元素和遮挡组合极大考验感知能力，从而凸显了该框架在真实应用中的价值。
