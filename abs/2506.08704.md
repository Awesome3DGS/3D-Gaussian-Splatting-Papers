### TraGraph-GS: Trajectory Graph-based Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary Large-Scale Scene Rendering

High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

在大规模场景中实现高质量的新视角合成，是三维计算机视觉领域面临的重大挑战。现有方法通常将大场景划分为多个子区域，对每个区域分别利用高斯喷溅（Gaussian Splatting）进行三维重建，并最终将其合并以生成新视角渲染。虽然这种方法能够对特定场景进行精确渲染，但在泛化性方面存在两大问题：(1) 刚性空间划分技术难以适应任意相机轨迹；(2) 多区域合并时的高斯重叠会导致纹理细节失真。
为解决这些问题，我们提出 TraGraph-GS，利用轨迹图（trajectory graph）实现对任意大规模场景的高精度渲染。我们提出了一种基于图的大规模场景空间划分方法，引入正则化约束以增强纹理与远处物体的渲染质量，并采用渐进式渲染策略以缓解高斯重叠带来的伪影。
实验结果表明，该方法在四个航拍数据集与四个地面数据集上均表现优异，并具有显著的效率优势：与当前最先进的方法相比，我们在航拍数据集上的平均 PSNR 提升 1.86 dB，在地面数据集上的平均 PSNR 提升 1.62 dB。
