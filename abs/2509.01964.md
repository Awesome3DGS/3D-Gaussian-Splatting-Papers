### 2D Gaussian Splatting with Semantic Alignment for Image Inpainting

Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing.

高斯溅射（GS）是一种将离散点转换为连续空间表示的新技术，已在三维场景建模和二维图像超分辨率任务中展现出良好效果。本文探索了其在图像修复中的潜力，该任务既要求局部像素生成的连贯性，也要求全局语义的统一性。我们提出了首个基于二维高斯溅射的图像修复框架，将不完整图像编码为二维高斯溅射系数的连续场，并通过可微分的光栅化过程重建最终图像。GS的连续渲染范式天然促进了修复结果在像素级的连贯性。为提高效率和可扩展性，我们引入了一种分块光栅化策略，降低了内存开销并加速推理。为了保持全局语义一致性，我们结合了预训练的DINO模型特征。我们观察到，DINO的全局特征对小缺失区域具有天然的鲁棒性，并能有效适应大遮罩场景中的语义对齐，从而确保修复内容与周围场景在语境上保持一致。大量在标准基准上的实验表明，我们的方法在定量指标和感知质量方面均取得了有竞争力的性能，为高斯溅射在二维图像处理中的应用开辟了新的方向。
