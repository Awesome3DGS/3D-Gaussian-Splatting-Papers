### Sketch and Patch: Efficient 3D Gaussian Representation for Man-Made Scenes

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising representation for photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, its high storage requirements pose significant challenges for practical applications. We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics that are analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- Like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features like edges and contours; While other Gaussians represent broader, smoother regions, that are analogous to broader brush strokes that add volume and depth to a painting. Based on this observation, we propose a novel hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which define scene boundaries, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover smooth regions. Sketch Gaussians are efficiently encoded using parametric models, leveraging their geometric coherence, while Patch Gaussians undergo optimized pruning, retraining, and vector quantization to maintain volumetric consistency and storage efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrates that this structure-aware approach achieves up to 32.62% improvement in PSNR, 19.12% in SSIM, and 45.41% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes, and correspondingly, for an indoor scene, our model maintains the visual quality with 2.3% of the original model size.

3D高斯点云（3DGS）作为一种用于3D场景写实渲染的有前景的表示方法，近年来受到关注。然而，它的高存储需求在实际应用中带来了显著挑战。我们观察到，高斯点云表现出不同的角色和特征，这些特征与传统艺术技法类似——就像艺术家在填充较大区域的颜色之前首先勾画出轮廓一样，部分高斯点云捕捉了高频特征，如边缘和轮廓；而其他高斯点云则代表了更广泛、更平滑的区域，类似于更大幅的笔触，给画作添加体积感和深度。基于这一观察，我们提出了一种新颖的混合表示方法，将高斯点云分为：（i）草图高斯点云，用于定义场景边界；（ii）贴片高斯点云，用于覆盖平滑区域。草图高斯点云通过利用其几何一致性，使用参数化模型进行高效编码；而贴片高斯点云则通过优化剪枝、再训练和向量量化等技术，以保持体积一致性和存储效率。我们在多种室内和室外场景中的综合评估表明，这种结构感知的方法在相同模型大小下，实现了高达32.62%的PSNR提升，19.12%的SSIM提升和45.41%的LPIPS提升；对于室内场景，我们的模型在原始模型大小的2.3%下，保持了视觉质量。
