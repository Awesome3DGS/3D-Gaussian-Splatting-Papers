### IDU: Incremental Dynamic Update of Existing 3D Virtual Environments with New Imagery Data

For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement, with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

为满足模拟和训练的需求，军方组织在高分辨率三维虚拟环境的构建上投入了大量资源，通过广泛的成像与三维扫描来实现。然而，战场环境的动态特性——物体可能随时间出现或消失——使得频繁的大规模更新既耗时又昂贵。为此，我们提出了增量动态更新（IDU）流水线，该方法能够仅依赖少量新获取的图像，高效更新已有的三维重建（如三维高斯溅射，3DGS）。我们的方案首先通过相机位姿估计将新图像与现有三维模型对齐，随后利用变化检测来定位场景中的改动。接着，利用三维生成式人工智能模型生成新元素的高质量三维资产，并无缝地融入到已有三维模型中。IDU 流水线还引入人工干预，以确保在目标识别和放置上的高精度，每次更新集中于单个新对象。实验结果表明，所提出的 IDU 流水线显著降低了更新所需的时间与人工成本，为快速变化的军事场景中保持最新三维模型提供了一种高效、低成本且有针对性的解决方案。
