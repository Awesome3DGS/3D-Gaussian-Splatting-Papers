### Gaussian in the Wild: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Unconstrained Image Collections

Novel view synthesis from unconstrained in-the-wild images remains a meaningful but challenging task. The photometric variation and transient occluders in those unconstrained images make it difficult to reconstruct the original scene accurately. Previous approaches tackle the problem by introducing a global appearance feature in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, in the real world, the unique appearance of each tiny point in a scene is determined by its independent intrinsic material attributes and the varying environmental impacts it receives. Inspired by this fact, we propose Gaussian in the wild (GS-W), a method that uses 3D Gaussian points to reconstruct the scene and introduces separated intrinsic and dynamic appearance feature for each point, capturing the unchanged scene appearance along with dynamic variation like illumination and weather. Additionally, an adaptive sampling strategy is presented to allow each Gaussian point to focus on the local and detailed information more effectively. We also reduce the impact of transient occluders using a 2D visibility map. More experiments have demonstrated better reconstruction quality and details of GS-W compared to previous methods, with a 1000× increase in rendering speed.

从不受约束的野外图像中合成新视角仍是一个有意义但充满挑战的任务。这些不受约束图像中的光度变化和瞬时遮挡物使得准确重建原始场景变得困难。以往的方法通过在神经辐射场（NeRF）中引入全局外观特征来解决这个问题。然而，在现实世界中，场景中每个微小点的独特外观是由其独立的内在材料属性和它接收的不同环境影响决定的。受此启发，我们提出了一种方法，名为野外中的高斯（GS-W），使用3D高斯点来重建场景，并为每个点引入分离的内在和动态外观特征，捕捉不变的场景外观以及光照和天气等动态变化。此外，我们提出了一种自适应采样策略，允许每个高斯点更有效地关注局部和详细信息。我们还使用2D可见性图减少了瞬时遮挡物的影响。更多实验已经证明，与以往方法相比，GS-W在重建质量和细节方面表现更好，渲染速度提高了1000倍。
