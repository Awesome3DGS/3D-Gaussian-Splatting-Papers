### ReCoGS: Real-time ReColoring for Gaussian Splatting scenes

Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a leading method for novel view synthesis, offering superior training efficiency and real-time inference compared to NeRF approaches, while still delivering high-quality reconstructions. Beyond view synthesis, this 3D representation has also been explored for editing tasks. Many existing methods leverage 2D diffusion models to generate multi-view datasets for training, but they often suffer from limitations such as view inconsistencies, lack of fine-grained control, and high computational demand. In this work, we focus specifically on the editing task of recoloring. We introduce a user-friendly pipeline that enables precise selection and recoloring of regions within a pre-trained Gaussian Splatting scene. To demonstrate the real-time performance of our method, we also present an interactive tool that allows users to experiment with the pipeline in practice.

高斯溅射（Gaussian Splatting）已成为新视角合成任务中的领先方法，在保持高质量重建效果的同时，相较于 NeRF 方法展现出更高的训练效率和实时推理能力。除了视角合成，该三维表示还被广泛应用于编辑任务。许多现有方法利用二维扩散模型生成多视角数据集进行训练，但常常存在视角不一致、控制粒度不足以及计算开销大的问题。在本工作中，我们聚焦于重新着色这一编辑任务，提出了一条用户友好的管线，可对预训练的高斯溅射场景中的特定区域进行精确选择与重新着色。为展示方法的实时性能，我们还开发了一个交互式工具，使用户能够在实践中便捷地体验和操作整个编辑流程。
