### MetroGS: Efficient and Stable Reconstruction of Geometrically Accurate High-Fidelity Large-Scale Scenes

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting and its derivatives have achieved significant breakthroughs in large-scale scene reconstruction. However, how to efficiently and stably achieve high-quality geometric fidelity remains a core challenge. To address this issue, we introduce MetroGS, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework for efficient and robust reconstruction in complex urban environments. Our method is built upon a distributed 2D Gaussian Splatting representation as the core foundation, serving as a unified backbone for subsequent modules. To handle potential sparse regions in complex scenes, we propose a structured dense enhancement scheme that utilizes SfM priors and a pointmap model to achieve a denser initialization, while incorporating a sparsity compensation mechanism to improve reconstruction completeness. Furthermore, we design a progressive hybrid geometric optimization strategy that organically integrates monocular and multi-view optimization to achieve efficient and accurate geometric refinement. Finally, to address the appearance inconsistency commonly observed in large-scale scenes, we introduce a depth-guided appearance modeling approach that learns spatial features with 3D consistency, facilitating effective decoupling between geometry and appearance and further enhancing reconstruction stability. Experiments on large-scale urban datasets demonstrate that MetroGS achieves superior geometric accuracy, rendering quality, offering a unified solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.

近年来，三维高斯溅射及其衍生方法在大规模场景重建中取得了显著突破。然而，如何高效且稳定地实现高质量几何保真仍然是核心挑战。为此，我们提出了 MetroGS，一种面向复杂城市环境的高效鲁棒重建高斯溅射框架。该方法以分布式二维高斯溅射表示为核心基础，作为统一主干支撑后续各模块。为应对复杂场景中可能出现的稀疏区域，我们提出了一种结构化稠密增强策略，结合SfM先验与点图模型进行稠密初始化，并引入稀疏性补偿机制以提升重建完整性。此外，我们设计了一种渐进式混合几何优化策略，将单目与多视角优化有机融合，实现高效精确的几何细化。针对大规模场景中常见的外观不一致问题，我们引入一种基于深度引导的外观建模方法，学习具有三维一致性的空间特征，实现几何与外观的有效解耦，进一步增强重建稳定性。在多个大规模城市数据集上的实验结果表明，MetroGS 在几何精度与渲染质量方面均取得领先性能，提供了一种统一的高保真大规模场景重建解决方案。
