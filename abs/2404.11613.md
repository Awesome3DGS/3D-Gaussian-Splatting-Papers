### InFusion: Inpainting 3D Gaussians via Learning Depth Completion from Diffusion Prior

3D Gaussians have recently emerged as an efficient representation for novel view synthesis. This work studies its editability with a particular focus on the inpainting task, which aims to supplement an incomplete set of 3D Gaussians with additional points for visually harmonious rendering. Compared to 2D inpainting, the crux of inpainting 3D Gaussians is to figure out the rendering-relevant properties of the introduced points, whose optimization largely benefits from their initial 3D positions. To this end, we propose to guide the point initialization with an image-conditioned depth completion model, which learns to directly restore the depth map based on the observed image. Such a design allows our model to fill in depth values at an aligned scale with the original depth, and also to harness strong generalizability from largescale diffusion prior. Thanks to the more accurate depth completion, our approach, dubbed InFusion, surpasses existing alternatives with sufficiently better fidelity and efficiency under various complex scenarios. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of InFusion with several practical applications, such as inpainting with user-specific texture or with novel object insertion.

三维高斯最近作为新视角合成的一种高效表示方式而出现。本研究着重探讨了其可编辑性，特别是针对补画任务，该任务旨在为不完整的三维高斯点集补充额外的点，以实现视觉上的和谐渲染。与二维补画相比，补画三维高斯的关键是确定引入点的渲染相关属性，这些属性的优化在很大程度上受益于它们最初的三维位置。为此，我们提出使用图像条件深度完成模型指导点的初始化，该模型学习基于观察到的图像直接恢复深度图。这种设计允许我们的模型在与原始深度对齐的尺度上填充深度值，并且还能利用大规模扩散先验的强大泛化能力。由于深度完成更加准确，我们的方法，名为 InFusion，在各种复杂场景下以更好的保真度和效率超越现有替代方案。我们进一步通过几个实际应用来展示 InFusion 的有效性，如使用用户特定纹理的补画或插入新的物体。
