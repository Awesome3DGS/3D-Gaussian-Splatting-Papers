### Feature Splatting for Better Novel View Synthesis with Low Overlap

3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a very promising scene representation, achieving state-of-the-art quality in novel view synthesis significantly faster than competing alternatives. However, its use of spherical harmonics to represent scene colors limits the expressivity of 3D Gaussians and, as a consequence, the capability of the representation to generalize as we move away from the training views. In this paper, we propose to encode the color information of 3D Gaussians into per-Gaussian feature vectors, which we denote as Feature Splatting (FeatSplat). To synthesize a novel view, Gaussians are first "splatted" into the image plane, then the corresponding feature vectors are alpha-blended, and finally the blended vector is decoded by a small MLP to render the RGB pixel values. To further inform the model, we concatenate a camera embedding to the blended feature vector, to condition the decoding also on the viewpoint information. Our experiments show that these novel model for encoding the radiance considerably improves novel view synthesis for low overlap views that are distant from the training views. Finally, we also show the capacity and convenience of our feature vector representation, demonstrating its capability not only to generate RGB values for novel views, but also their per-pixel semantic labels.

三维高斯喷溅作为一种非常有前景的场景表示方法，已在新视角合成方面实现了前所未有的质量，其速度远快于竞争性替代方法。然而，它使用球谐函数来表示场景颜色限制了三维高斯的表达能力，因此，当我们远离训练视图时，该表示的泛化能力也受到限制。在本文中，我们提出将三维高斯的颜色信息编码到每个高斯的特征向量中，我们将这种方法称为特征喷溅（FeatSplat）。为了合成一个新的视角，首先将高斯“喷溅”到图像平面上，然后将相应的特征向量进行alpha混合，最后通过一个小型的多层感知器（MLP）解码混合向量，渲染出RGB像素值。为了进一步提供模型信息，我们将相机嵌入向量与混合特征向量连接起来，以便也根据视点信息进行解码条件设置。我们的实验表明，这种新的辐射编码模型显著提高了对训练视图远离且重叠度低的新视图的合成质量。最后，我们还展示了我们特征向量表示的容量和便利性，证明了它不仅能为新视图生成RGB值，还能生成每个像素的语义标签。
