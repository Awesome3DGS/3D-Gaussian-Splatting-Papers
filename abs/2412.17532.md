### Exploring Dynamic Novel View Synthesis Technologies for Cinematography

Novel view synthesis (NVS) has shown significant promise for applications in cinematographic production, particularly through the exploitation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). These methods model real 3D scenes, enabling the creation of new shots that are challenging to capture in the real world due to set topology or expensive equipment requirement. This innovation also offers cinematographic advantages such as smooth camera movements, virtual re-shoots, slow-motion effects, etc. This paper explores dynamic NVS with the aim of facilitating the model selection process. We showcase its potential through a short montage filmed using various NVS models.

新颖视图合成（Novel View Synthesis，NVS）在电影制作等应用中展现了显著的前景，尤其是通过利用神经辐射场（Neural Radiance Fields，NeRF）和高斯点云（Gaussian Splatting，GS）。这些方法对真实的三维场景进行建模，使得创建在现实世界中由于场景拓扑或昂贵设备需求而难以捕捉的新镜头成为可能。这一创新还提供了诸如平滑的相机运动、虚拟重拍、慢动作效果等电影制作优势。本文探讨了动态NVS，旨在简化模型选择过程。我们通过使用各种NVS模型拍摄的短片展示了其潜力。
