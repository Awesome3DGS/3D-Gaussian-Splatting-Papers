### Evaluating Fisheye-Compatible 3D Gaussian Splatting Methods on Real Images Beyond 180 Degree Field of View

We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180 degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200 degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view (200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200 degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and distortion-heavy image inputs.

我们首次对基于鱼眼的3D高斯溅射方法——Fisheye-GS和3DGUT——在视场超过180度的真实图像上进行了评估。我们的研究涵盖了使用200度鱼眼相机拍摄的室内和室外场景，并分析了每种方法在现实环境中应对极端畸变的表现。我们在不同的视场条件下（200度、160度和120度）进行了性能评估，以研究边缘畸变与空间覆盖之间的权衡。Fisheye-GS在视场缩减时（尤其在160度）表现获益，而3DGUT在所有设置下均保持稳定，并在完整200度视角下维持高水平的感知质量。为解决基于SfM的初始化在强畸变下常常失效的问题，我们提出了一种基于深度的策略，利用每个场景仅2-3张鱼眼图像的UniK3D预测。尽管UniK3D并未在真实鱼眼数据上进行训练，但它能够生成密集点云，使得重建质量即使在雾气、眩光或天空等复杂场景下也能与SfM相媲美。我们的结果突显了基于鱼眼的3DGS方法在稀疏且高畸变图像输入条件下实现广角3D重建的实际可行性。
