### MirrorGaussian: Reflecting 3D Gaussians for Reconstructing Mirror Reflections

3D Gaussian Splatting showcases notable advancements in photo-realistic and real-time novel view synthesis. However, it faces challenges in modeling mirror reflections, which exhibit substantial appearance variations from different viewpoints. To tackle this problem, we present MirrorGaussian, the first method for mirror scene reconstruction with real-time rendering based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. The key insight is grounded on the mirror symmetry between the real-world space and the virtual mirror space. We introduce an intuitive dual-rendering strategy that enables differentiable rasterization of both the real-world 3D Gaussians and the mirrored counterpart obtained by reflecting the former about the mirror plane. All 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized with the mirror plane in an end-to-end framework. MirrorGaussian achieves high-quality and real-time rendering in scenes with mirrors, empowering scene editing like adding new mirrors and objects. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

3D高斯喷溅在光度真实和实时新视角合成方面展示了显著的进步。然而，它在模拟镜面反射时面临挑战，这些反射从不同视点显示出显著的外观变化。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了MirrorGaussian，这是第一个基于3D高斯喷溅进行镜面场景重建并实现实时渲染的方法。关键见解基于真实世界空间与虚拟镜面空间之间的镜面对称性。我们引入了一种直观的双重渲染策略，使得真实世界的3D高斯和通过镜面反射得到的镜像部分都能进行可微栅格化。所有3D高斯与镜面一起在端到端框架中进行联合优化。MirrorGaussian在含镜子的场景中实现了高质量和实时渲染，增强了场景编辑能力，如添加新镜子和物体。在多个数据集上的全面实验表明，我们的方法显著超过现有方法，达到了最先进的结果。
