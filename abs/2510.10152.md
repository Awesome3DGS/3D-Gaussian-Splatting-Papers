### Color3D: Controllable and Consistent 3D Colorization with Personalized Colorizer

In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view, enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control.

本文提出了Color3D，一个高度灵活的框架，可从单色输入中为静态与动态三维场景进行上色，生成具有视觉多样性和色彩丰富性的重建结果，并支持灵活的用户引导控制。与现有方法仅关注静态场景，并通过对颜色变化取平均以实现多视角一致性（从而不可避免地牺牲色彩丰富性与可控性）不同，我们的方法在保证视角间与时间间一致性的同时，保留了颜色多样性与可操控性。我们方法的核心思想在于仅对一个关键视角进行上色，并通过微调一个个性化上色器，将其颜色传播至新视角和时间帧。通过个性化训练，该上色器能够学习参考视图中场景特定的确定性颜色映射，利用其固有的归纳偏置，将对应颜色一致地投射到新视角与视频帧中的内容上。训练完成后，该个性化上色器可用于为所有其他图像推断一致的色度，从而直接重建出具有专用Lab色彩空间高斯泼溅表示的彩色三维场景。该框架巧妙地将复杂的三维上色任务转化为更易处理的单图像范式，使任意图像上色模型得以无缝集成，并具备更高的灵活性与可控性。我们在多个静态与动态三维上色基准上进行了大量实验证明，Color3D能够在提供精确用户控制的同时，实现更一致、色彩更丰富的渲染效果。
