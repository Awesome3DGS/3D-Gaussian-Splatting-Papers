### Plug-and-Play PDE Optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting: Toward High-Quality Rendering and Reconstruction

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized radiance field reconstruction by achieving high-quality novel view synthesis with fast rendering speed, introducing 3D Gaussian primitives to represent the scene. However, 3DGS encounters blurring and floaters when applied to complex scenes, caused by the reconstruction of redundant and ambiguous geometric structures. We attribute this issue to the unstable optimization of the Gaussians. To address this limitation, we present a plug-and-play PDE-based optimization method that overcomes the optimization constraints of 3DGS-based approaches in various tasks, such as novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Firstly, we theoretically derive that the 3DGS optimization procedure can be modeled as a PDE, and introduce a viscous term to ensure stable optimization. Secondly, we use the Material Point Method (MPM) to obtain a stable numerical solution of the PDE, which enhances both global and local constraints. Additionally, an effective Gaussian densification strategy and particle constraints are introduced to ensure fine-grained details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering and reconstruction quality.

三维高斯溅射（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）以其高速渲染与高质量的新视图合成能力，革新了辐射场重建方法，引入三维高斯基元作为场景表示。然而，当 3DGS 应用于复杂场景时，常会出现模糊与漂浮伪影等问题，其根源在于冗余和模糊几何结构的重建。我们将这一现象归因于高斯基元优化过程的不稳定性。为解决这一问题，本文提出了一种可即插即用的基于偏微分方程（PDE）的优化方法，突破了现有 3DGS 方法在新视图合成与表面重建等任务中的优化限制。首先，我们从理论上推导出 3DGS 的优化过程可建模为一个 PDE，并引入粘性项以确保优化的稳定性。其次，我们采用材料点法（Material Point Method, MPM）来求解 PDE 的稳定数值解，从而在全局与局部层面同时增强约束。此外，我们还提出了一种有效的高斯致密化策略与粒子约束机制，以保证细节的精细表达。大量定性与定量实验结果表明，本文方法在渲染与重建质量上均达到了当前最优水平。
