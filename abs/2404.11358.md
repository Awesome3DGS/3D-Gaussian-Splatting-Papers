### DeblurGS: Gaussian Splatting for Camera Motion Blur

Although significant progress has been made in reconstructing sharp 3D scenes from motion-blurred images, a transition to real-world applications remains challenging. The primary obstacle stems from the severe blur which leads to inaccuracies in the acquisition of initial camera poses through Structure-from-Motion, a critical aspect often overlooked by previous approaches. To address this challenge, we propose DeblurGS, a method to optimize sharp 3D Gaussian Splatting from motion-blurred images, even with the noisy camera pose initialization. We restore a fine-grained sharp scene by leveraging the remarkable reconstruction capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach estimates the 6-Degree-of-Freedom camera motion for each blurry observation and synthesizes corresponding blurry renderings for the optimization process. Furthermore, we propose Gaussian Densification Annealing strategy to prevent the generation of inaccurate Gaussians at erroneous locations during the early training stages when camera motion is still imprecise. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our DeblurGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in deblurring and novel view synthesis for real-world and synthetic benchmark datasets, as well as field-captured blurry smartphone videos.

尽管在从运动模糊图像重建清晰的三维场景方面取得了显著进展，但向现实世界应用的过渡仍然面临挑战。主要障碍源于严重的模糊，这导致通过结构从运动（Structure-from-Motion）获取初始相机姿态时出现不准确性，这一关键方面常被先前方法忽视。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种方法 DeblurGS，即使在初始相机姿态带有噪声的情况下，也能优化从运动模糊图像恢复清晰的三维高斯打点（Gaussian Splatting）。我们通过利用三维高斯打点的卓越重建能力，恢复出细致的清晰场景。我们的方法估计每个模糊观察中的六自由度相机运动，并为优化过程合成相应的模糊渲染。此外，我们提出了高斯密度退火策略，以防止在相机运动尚不精确的早期训练阶段，在错误位置生成不准确的高斯。全面的实验表明，我们的 DeblurGS 在实际和合成基准数据集以及现场捕获的模糊智能手机视频的去模糊和新视角合成方面达到了业界领先水平。
