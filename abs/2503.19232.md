### HoGS: Unified Near and Far Object Reconstruction via Homogeneous Gaussian Splatting

Novel view synthesis has demonstrated impressive progress recently, with 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) offering efficient training time and photorealistic real-time rendering. However, reliance on Cartesian coordinates limits 3DGS's performance on distant objects, which is important for reconstructing unbounded outdoor environments. We found that, despite its ultimate simplicity, using homogeneous coordinates, a concept on the projective geometry, for the 3DGS pipeline remarkably improves the rendering accuracies of distant objects. We therefore propose Homogeneous Gaussian Splatting (HoGS) incorporating homogeneous coordinates into the 3DGS framework, providing a unified representation for enhancing near and distant objects. HoGS effectively manages both expansive spatial positions and scales particularly in outdoor unbounded environments by adopting projective geometry principles. Experiments show that HoGS significantly enhances accuracy in reconstructing distant objects while maintaining high-quality rendering of nearby objects, along with fast training speed and real-time rendering capability.

新视角合成（Novel View Synthesis）近年来取得了令人瞩目的进展，其中三维高斯溅射（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）在高效训练和真实感实时渲染方面表现突出。然而，3DGS 对笛卡尔坐标的依赖限制了其在远距离物体重建中的性能，而这在重建无边界的户外环境时尤为关键。我们发现，尽管方法极其简洁，将投影几何中的齐次坐标引入 3DGS 流水线，可以显著提升远距离物体的渲染精度。因此，我们提出了 齐次高斯溅射（Homogeneous Gaussian Splatting, HoGS），将齐次坐标融入 3DGS 框架中，提供统一的表示方式以同时增强近距离和远距离物体的渲染质量。HoGS 通过采用投影几何的原理，有效处理了户外无边界场景中广阔的空间位置与尺度变化。实验结果表明，HoGS 在保持近距离物体高质量渲染和快速训练、实时渲染能力的同时，大幅提升了远距离物体的重建精度。
