### 3D Gaussian Radiation Field Modeling for Integrated RIS-FAS Systems: Analysis and Optimization

The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and fluid antenna systems (FAS) has attracted considerable attention due to its tremendous potential in enhancing wireless communication performance. However, under fast-fading channel conditions, rapidly and effectively performing joint optimization of the antenna positions in an FAS system and the RIS phase configuration remains a critical challenge. Traditional optimization methods typically rely on complex iterative computations, thus making it challenging to obtain optimal solutions in real time within dynamic channel environments. To address this issue, this paper introduces a field information-driven optimization method based on three-dimensional Gaussian radiation-field modeling for real-time optimization of integrated FAS-RIS systems. In the proposed approach, obstacles are treated as virtual transmitters and, by separately learning the amplitude and phase variations, the model can quickly generate high-precision channel information based on the transmitter's position. This design eliminates the need for extensive pilot overhead and cumbersome computations. On this framework, an alternating optimization scheme is presented to jointly optimize the FAS position and the RIS phase configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of spectrum prediction accuracy, convergence speed, and minimum achievable rate, validating its effectiveness and practicality in fast-fading scenarios.

可重构智能表面（RIS）与流动天线系统（FAS）的融合因其在提升无线通信性能方面的巨大潜力而备受关注。然而，在快衰落信道条件下，如何快速且高效地联合优化FAS系统中的天线位置与RIS的相位配置，仍然是一个关键难题。传统的优化方法通常依赖于复杂的迭代计算，因此难以在动态信道环境中实时获得最优解。为了解决这一问题，本文提出了一种基于三维高斯辐射场建模的场信息驱动优化方法，用于FAS-RIS一体化系统的实时优化。在该方法中，将障碍物视为虚拟发射源，并通过分别学习振幅与相位的变化，模型能够依据发射源位置快速生成高精度的信道信息。这一设计免去了大量导频开销与繁重的计算。在此框架下，进一步提出了一种交替优化机制，用于联合优化FAS的位置与RIS的相位配置。仿真结果表明，该方法在频谱预测精度、收敛速度以及最小可达速率等方面显著优于现有方法，验证了其在快衰落场景中的有效性与实用性。
