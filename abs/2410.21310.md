### ArCSEM: Artistic Colorization of SEM Images via Gaussian Splatting

Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) are widely renowned for their ability to analyze the surface structures of microscopic objects, offering the capability to capture highly detailed, yet only grayscale, images. To create more expressive and realistic illustrations, these images are typically manually colorized by an artist with the support of image editing software. This task becomes highly laborious when multiple images of a scanned object require colorization. We propose facilitating this process by using the underlying 3D structure of the microscopic scene to propagate the color information to all the captured images, from as little as one colorized view. We explore several scene representation techniques and achieve high-quality colorized novel view synthesis of a SEM scene. In contrast to prior work, there is no manual intervention or labelling involved in obtaining the 3D representation. This enables an artist to color a single or few views of a sequence and automatically retrieve a fully colored scene or video.

扫描电子显微镜（SEM）因其分析微观物体表面结构的能力而广受认可，能够捕捉高度精细的图像，但仅限于灰度显示。为了创造更具表现力和真实感的图像，这些图像通常由艺术家借助图像编辑软件手动上色。当需要对同一扫描物体的多张图像进行上色时，此任务显得尤为繁重。我们提出利用微观场景的三维结构，将色彩信息传播到所有捕获的图像中，从而简化这一过程，仅需一个上色视图即可实现。我们探讨了几种场景表示技术，并实现了SEM场景的高质量彩色新视角合成。与以往的工作不同，我们无需手动干预或标签来获得三维表示，从而使艺术家只需对序列中的一个或少数视角进行上色，即可自动获得完整上色的场景或视频。
