### 3D Gaussian Splatting Driven Multi-View Robust Physical Adversarial Camouflage Generation

Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA.

物理对抗攻击方法揭示了深度神经网络的脆弱性，并对自动驾驶等安全关键场景构成了重大威胁。相比基于补丁的攻击，基于伪装的物理攻击在复杂物理环境中具有更强的对抗效果，因此更具潜力。然而，大多数现有工作依赖于目标物体的网格先验以及由模拟器构建的虚拟环境，这些先验的获取过程耗时且不可避免地与真实世界存在差异。此外，由于训练图像背景的局限性，现有方法往往难以生成具备多视角鲁棒性的对抗伪装，并容易陷入次优解。基于上述原因，以往方法在多样化视角和物理环境下的对抗有效性与鲁棒性均不足。为此，我们提出了一种基于三维高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）的物理攻击框架——PGA，该框架能够利用少量图像实现快速且精确的重建，并具备照片级逼真的渲染能力。我们的框架通过防止高斯之间的相互遮挡和自遮挡，并采用极小极大优化方法调整每个视角的成像背景，从而提升跨视角的鲁棒性与对抗效果，帮助算法过滤掉非鲁棒的对抗特征。大量实验验证了 PGA 的有效性与优越性。
