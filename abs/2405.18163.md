### NegGS: Negative Gaussian Splatting

One of the key advantages of 3D rendering is its ability to simulate intricate scenes accurately. One of the most widely used methods for this purpose is Gaussian Splatting, a novel approach that is known for its rapid training and inference capabilities. In essence, Gaussian Splatting involves incorporating data about the 3D objects of interest into a series of Gaussian distributions, each of which can then be depicted in 3D in a manner analogous to traditional meshes. It is regrettable that the use of Gaussians in Gaussian Splatting is currently somewhat restrictive due to their perceived linear nature. In practice, 3D objects are often composed of complex curves and highly nonlinear structures. This issue can to some extent be alleviated by employing a multitude of Gaussian components to reflect the complex, nonlinear structures accurately. However, this approach results in a considerable increase in time complexity. This paper introduces the concept of negative Gaussians, which are interpreted as items with negative colors. The rationale behind this approach is based on the density distribution created by dividing the probability density functions (PDFs) of two Gaussians, which we refer to as Diff-Gaussian. Such a distribution can be used to approximate structures such as donut and moon-shaped datasets. Experimental findings indicate that the application of these techniques enhances the modeling of high-frequency elements with rapid color transitions. Additionally, it improves the representation of shadows. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to extend the simple elipsoid shapes of Gaussian Splatting to more complex nonlinear structures.

3D渲染的一个关键优势是其能够精确模拟复杂场景。高斯喷溅是为此目的广泛使用的方法之一，这种新颖的方法以其快速训练和推理能力而闻名。本质上，高斯喷溅涉及将有关感兴趣的3D对象的数据融入到一系列高斯分布中，每个分布随后可以以类似于传统网格的方式在3D中进行描述。遗憾的是，目前由于对其线性特性的认识，使用高斯喷溅中的高斯分布有些受限。实际上，3D对象往往由复杂的曲线和高度非线性的结构组成。通过使用多个高斯组件来准确反映复杂的非线性结构可以在一定程度上缓解这一问题。然而，这种方法导致时间复杂性显著增加。本文介绍了负高斯的概念，这些高斯被解释为具有负色彩的物体。该方法背后的理由基于通过两个高斯的概率密度函数（PDF）相除创建的密度分布，我们称之为 Diff-Gaussian。这样的分布可用于近似甜甜圈形和月牙形数据集等结构。实验结果表明，这些技术的应用增强了对快速色彩过渡的高频元素的建模。此外，它改善了阴影的表现。据我们所知，这是第一篇将高斯喷溅的简单椭球形状扩展到更复杂的非线性结构的论文。
