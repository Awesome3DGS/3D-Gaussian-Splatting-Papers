### DriveSplat: Decoupled Driving Scene Reconstruction with Geometry-enhanced Partitioned Neural Gaussians

In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles, pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near, middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation. Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors, whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network. The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

在驾驶场景中，快速移动的车辆、行进中的行人以及大规模静态背景给三维场景重建带来了显著挑战。近期基于三维高斯溅射的方法通过对场景中的动态与静态部分进行解耦来应对运动模糊问题。然而，这些解耦策略忽视了具有充分几何关系的背景优化，仅依赖于通过添加高斯来拟合每个训练视角。因此，这类模型在新视角渲染时鲁棒性有限，且缺乏准确的几何表示。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了 DriveSplat，这是一种基于神经高斯表示并结合动静态解耦的高质量驾驶场景重建方法。为了更好地适应驾驶视角中主要呈线性运动的特点，我们采用了区域划分体素初始化方案，将场景划分为近、中、远三个区域，以增强近景细节的表示能力。我们进一步引入可变形神经高斯来建模非刚体动态目标，其参数通过可学习的形变网络在时间维度上进行调整。整个框架还受到来自预训练模型的深度与法线先验的监督，从而提升几何结构的准确性。我们在 Waymo 和 KITTI 数据集上对该方法进行了严格评估，结果表明 DriveSplat 在驾驶场景的新视角合成任务中达到了当前最优性能。
