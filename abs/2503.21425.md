### STAMICS: Splat, Track And Map with Integrated Consistency and Semantics for Dense RGB-D SLAM

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical task in robotics, enabling systems to autonomously navigate and understand complex environments. Current SLAM approaches predominantly rely on geometric cues for mapping and localization, but they often fail to ensure semantic consistency, particularly in dynamic or densely populated scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce STAMICS, a novel method that integrates semantic information with 3D Gaussian representations to enhance both localization and mapping accuracy. STAMICS consists of three key components: a 3D Gaussian-based scene representation for high-fidelity reconstruction, a graph-based clustering technique that enforces temporal semantic consistency, and an open-vocabulary system that allows for the classification of unseen objects. Extensive experiments show that STAMICS significantly improves camera pose estimation and map quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while reducing reconstruction errors.

同时定位与建图（Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, SLAM）是机器人领域的一项关键任务，使系统能够自主导航并理解复杂环境。当前的 SLAM 方法主要依赖几何线索进行建图和定位，但在动态或高密度场景中往往难以保证语义一致性。为了解决这一限制，我们提出了 STAMICS，这是一种将语义信息与三维高斯表示相结合的新方法，以提升定位和建图的精度。STAMICS 包含三个核心组件：基于三维高斯的场景表示，用于实现高保真重建；基于图的聚类技术，用于强制执行时间上的语义一致性；以及一个开放词汇系统，能够对未见过的物体进行分类。大量实验表明，STAMICS 显著提升了相机位姿估计与地图质量，在降低重建误差的同时，性能优于当前的先进方法。
