### CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-Consistency from a Single Image

Reconstructing clothed humans from a single image is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications. Although existing monocular clothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often rely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free environment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these algorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions. Additionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage geometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are extremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-ConsistEncy from a Single Image, a novel pipeline designed to reconstruct occlusion-resilient 3D humans with multiview consistency from a single occluded image, without requiring either ground-truth geometric prior annotations or 3D supervision. Specifically, CHROME leverages a multiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from the occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly enforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is then trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded input and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive and accurate 3D representation. CHROME achieves significant improvements in terms of both novel view synthesis (upto 3 db PSNR) and geometric reconstruction under challenging conditions.

从单张图像重建穿衣人类是计算机视觉中的一个基本任务，具有广泛的应用前景。尽管现有的单目穿衣人类重建解决方案已取得了令人鼓舞的成果，但它们通常依赖于一个假设：即人类对象处于无遮挡环境中。因此，当遇到野外遮挡图像时，这些算法会产生多视角不一致和碎片化的重建结果。此外，大多数单目 3D 人类重建算法利用几何先验（如 SMPL 注释）进行训练和推理，但这些先验在现实世界应用中非常难以获得。
为了解决这些问题，我们提出了 CHROME：Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-Consistency from a Single Image，一个新颖的管道，旨在从单张遮挡图像中重建具有遮挡鲁棒性和多视角一致性的 3D 人体，而不需要任何地面真值几何先验注释或3D 监督。
具体而言，CHROME 利用多视角扩散模型，首先从遮挡的输入图像中合成无遮挡的穿衣人类图像，且与现有的姿态控制兼容，在合成过程中显式地强制执行视角间的一致性。然后，训练一个3D 重建模型，该模型在遮挡的输入和合成视角的条件下预测一组 3D 高斯点，通过对齐视角间的细节，生成一个连贯且准确的 3D 表示。
CHROME 在新视角合成（最大提升 3 dB PSNR）和几何重建方面，尤其在挑战性条件下，取得了显著的改进。
