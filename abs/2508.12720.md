### Quantifying and Alleviating Co-Adaptation in Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios, despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians, i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians. The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.

三维高斯泼溅（3DGS）在密集视角条件下的新视角合成中展现了令人印象深刻的性能。然而，在稀疏视角场景中，尽管在训练视角渲染效果逼真，3DGS 在新视角中偶尔会出现外观伪影。本文研究了稀疏视角 3DGS 中的外观伪影，并揭示了当前方法的一个核心局限：优化得到的高斯之间过度耦合，过于激进地拟合训练视角，导致忽略了场景真实的外观分布，从而在新视角中产生伪影。我们的分析基于一个提出的指标——**协同适应分数（Co-Adaptation Score, CA）**，该指标通过在相同视角下多次渲染并使用不同随机子集的高斯，计算像素级方差来量化高斯之间的耦合程度。分析结果表明，随着训练视角数量的增加，协同适应程度自然减轻。基于此分析，我们提出了两种轻量化策略来显式缓解稀疏视角 3DGS 中的协同适应：(1) 随机高斯丢弃；(2) 对不透明度注入乘性噪声。这两种策略均为即插即用，并在多种方法与基准上验证了其有效性。我们希望对协同适应效应的洞察能够激发社区对稀疏视角 3DGS 的更全面理解。
