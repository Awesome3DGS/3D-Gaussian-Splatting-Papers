### SGCR: Spherical Gaussians for Efficient 3D Curve Reconstruction

Neural rendering techniques have made substantial progress in generating photo-realistic 3D scenes. The latest 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has achieved high quality novel view synthesis as well as fast rendering speed. However, 3D Gaussians lack proficiency in defining accurate 3D geometric structures despite their explicit primitive representations. This is due to the fact that Gaussian's attributes are primarily tailored and fine-tuned for rendering diverse 2D images by their anisotropic nature. To pave the way for efficient 3D reconstruction, we present Spherical Gaussians, a simple and effective representation for 3D geometric boundaries, from which we can directly reconstruct 3D feature curves from a set of calibrated multi-view images. Spherical Gaussians is optimized from grid initialization with a view-based rendering loss, where a 2D edge map is rendered at a specific view and then compared to the ground-truth edge map extracted from the corresponding image, without the need for any 3D guidance or supervision. Given Spherical Gaussians serve as intermedia for the robust edge representation, we further introduce a novel optimization-based algorithm called SGCR to directly extract accurate parametric curves from aligned Spherical Gaussians. We demonstrate that SGCR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in 3D edge reconstruction while enjoying great efficiency.

神经渲染技术在生成真实感三维场景方面取得了显著进展。最新的三维高斯泼溅（3D Gaussian Splatting）方法在实现高质量的新视角合成和快速渲染方面表现优异。然而，尽管 3D 高斯采用了显式图元表示，其在精确建模三维几何结构方面仍存在不足。这主要是因为高斯图元的属性本质上具有各向异性，设计初衷是为了优化多样化二维图像的渲染效果，而非几何结构表达。
为实现高效三维重建，本文提出了一种简单而有效的三维几何边界表示形式——球面高斯（Spherical Gaussians），可用于从一组已标定的多视角图像中直接重建三维特征曲线。球面高斯从网格初始化出发，通过基于视图的渲染损失进行优化。在特定视角下渲染出二维边缘图，并与对应图像中提取的真实边缘图进行比较，无需任何三维监督或引导。
由于球面高斯可作为鲁棒边缘表示的中介，我们进一步提出了一种优化算法 SGCR，可从配准后的球面高斯中直接提取高精度的参数化三维曲线。实验表明，SGCR 在三维边缘重建任务中优于现有最先进方法，同时具备极高的效率。
