### Octree-GS: Towards Consistent Real-time Rendering with LOD-Structured 3D Gaussians

The recent 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has shown remarkable rendering fidelity and efficiency compared to NeRF-based neural scene representations. While demonstrating the potential for real-time rendering, 3D-GS encounters rendering bottlenecks in large scenes with complex details due to an excessive number of Gaussian primitives located within the viewing frustum. This limitation is particularly noticeable in zoom-out views and can lead to inconsistent rendering speeds in scenes with varying details. Moreover, it often struggles to capture the corresponding level of details at different scales with its heuristic density control operation. Inspired by the Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques, we introduce Octree-GS, featuring an LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach supporting level-of-detail decomposition for scene representation that contributes to the final rendering results. Our model dynamically selects the appropriate level from the set of multi-resolution anchor points, ensuring consistent rendering performance with adaptive LOD adjustments while maintaining high-fidelity rendering results.

近期的三维高斯Splatting（3D-GS）与基于NeRF的神经场景表示相比，显示出了显著的渲染保真度和效率。虽然展示了实时渲染的潜力，但3D-GS在处理大型场景中的复杂细节时遇到了渲染瓶颈，这是由于观察视锥内存在过多的高斯原语所致。这个限制在缩小视图时特别明显，并且在细节变化的场景中可能导致渲染速度不一致。此外，它在用启发式密度控制操作捕获不同比例下相应细节水平时常常遇到困难。受到细节层次（LOD）技术的启发，我们引入了Octree-GS，它采用了LOD结构化的三维高斯方法，支持场景表示的细节层次分解，有助于最终渲染结果。我们的模型动态地从多分辨率锚点集合中选择合适的层次，确保在保持高保真渲染结果的同时，通过自适应LOD调整来保证一致的渲染性能。
