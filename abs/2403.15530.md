### Pixel-GS: Density Control with Pixel-aware Gradient for 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results while advancing real-time rendering performance. However, it relies heavily on the quality of the initial point cloud, resulting in blurring and needle-like artifacts in areas with insufficient initializing points. This is mainly attributed to the point cloud growth condition in 3DGS that only considers the average gradient magnitude of points from observable views, thereby failing to grow for large Gaussians that are observable for many viewpoints while many of them are only covered in the boundaries. To this end, we propose a novel method, named Pixel-GS, to take into account the number of pixels covered by the Gaussian in each view during the computation of the growth condition. We regard the covered pixel numbers as the weights to dynamically average the gradients from different views, such that the growth of large Gaussians can be prompted. As a result, points within the areas with insufficient initializing points can be grown more effectively, leading to a more accurate and detailed reconstruction. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to scale the gradient field according to the distance to the camera, to suppress the growth of floaters near the camera. Extensive experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed, on the challenging Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples datasets.

3D高斯喷溅（3DGS）在推进实时渲染性能的同时，展示了令人印象深刻的新视角合成结果。然而，它严重依赖于初始点云的质量，导致在初始化点不足的区域出现模糊和针状伪影。这主要归因于3DGS中的点云生长条件只考虑了来自可观察视图的点的平均梯度大小，因此对于许多视点可观察但许多仅在边界覆盖的大高斯，它未能进行生长。为此，我们提出了一种新的方法，名为Pixel-GS，考虑在计算生长条件时，每个视图中高斯覆盖的像素数。我们将覆盖的像素数视为权重，以动态平均不同视图的梯度，使得可以促进大高斯的生长。结果，可以更有效地增长初始化点不足区域内的点，导致更准确和详细的重建。此外，我们提出了一种简单而有效的策略，根据到相机的距离缩放梯度场，以抑制靠近相机的浮点生长。大量的实验，无论是定性的还是定量的，都证明了我们的方法在挑战性的Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks & Temples数据集上，实现了最先进的渲染质量，同时保持了实时渲染速度。
