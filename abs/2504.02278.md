### Digital-twin imaging based on descattering Gaussian splatting

Three-dimensional imaging through scattering media is important in medical science and astronomy. We propose a digital-twin imaging method based on Gaussian splatting to observe an object behind a scattering medium. A digital twin model built through data assimilation, emulates the behavior of objects and environmental changes in a virtual space. By constructing a digital twin using point clouds composed of Gaussians and simulating the scattering process through the convolution of a point spread function, three-dimensional objects behind a scattering medium can be reproduced as a digital twin. In this study, a high-contrast digital twin reproducing a three-dimensional object was successfully constructed from degraded images, assuming that data were acquired from wavefronts disturbed by a scattering medium. This technique reproduces objects by integrating data processing with image measurements.

通过散射介质进行三维成像在医学和天文学领域具有重要意义。我们提出了一种基于Gaussian Splatting 的数字孪生成像方法，用于观察隐藏在散射介质后的目标物体。
该方法通过数据同化构建数字孪生模型，在虚拟空间中模拟物体行为及环境变化。具体而言，我们利用由高斯点云构成的三维场景构建数字孪生，并通过点扩散函数（PSF）卷积模拟散射过程，从而再现被散射介质遮挡的三维物体。
在本研究中，我们在假设波前受散射介质扰动的前提下，从退化图像中成功构建出了高对比度的三维数字孪生体。该技术通过数据处理与图像测量的融合，实现了目标物体的重建。
