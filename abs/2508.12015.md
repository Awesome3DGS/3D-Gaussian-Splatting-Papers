### InstDrive: Instance-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for Driving Scenes

Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted increasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene understanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most methods still unify all background elements into a single representation, hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the 3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving.

从行车记录仪视频中重建动态驾驶场景因其在自动驾驶与场景理解中的重要性而受到越来越多的关注。尽管近年来取得了显著进展，大多数方法仍然将所有背景元素统一为单一表示，这阻碍了实例级理解与灵活的场景编辑。一些方法尝试将二维分割提升到三维空间，但往往依赖预处理的实例 ID 或复杂的流程来将连续特征映射为离散身份。此外，这些方法通常针对具有丰富视角的室内场景设计，因而在室外驾驶场景中的适用性较差。本文提出 **InstDrive**，一种面向动态驾驶场景交互式重建的实例感知三维高斯泼溅框架。我们使用由 SAM 生成的掩码作为伪真值，通过对比损失与伪监督目标引导二维特征学习。在三维层面，我们引入正则化以隐式编码实例身份，并通过基于体素的损失来强化一致性。一个轻量化的静态码本进一步桥接连续特征与离散身份，无需数据预处理或复杂优化。定量与定性实验结果表明了 InstDrive 的有效性，据我们所知，这是首个在动态开放驾驶场景中实现三维实例分割的框架。
