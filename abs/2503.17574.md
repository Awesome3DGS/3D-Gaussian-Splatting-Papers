### Is there anything left? Measuring semantic residuals of objects removed from 3D Gaussian Splatting

Searching in and editing 3D scenes has become extremely intuitive with trainable scene representations that allow linking human concepts to elements in the scene. These operations are often evaluated on the basis of how accurately the searched element is segmented or extracted from the scene. In this paper, we address the inverse problem, that is, how much of the searched element remains in the scene after it is removed. This question is particularly important in the context of privacy-preserving mapping when a user reconstructs a 3D scene and wants to remove private elements before sharing the map. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address this question. To answer this, we propose a quantitative evaluation that measures whether a removal operation leaves object residuals that can be reasoned over. The scene is not private when such residuals are present. Experiments on state-of-the-art scene representations show that the proposed metrics are meaningful and consistent with the user study that we also present. We also propose a method to refine the removal based on spatial and semantic consistency.


得益于可训练的场景表示，3D 场景的搜索与编辑变得极其直观，这使得人类概念可以自然地与场景中的元素建立联系。这类操作通常基于所搜索元素在场景中被准确分割或提取的程度进行评估。而本文关注的是一个逆问题：在某个元素被移除后，该元素在场景中还残留了多少痕迹。这一问题在隐私保护地图构建中尤为关键，例如当用户重建一个 3D 场景并希望在共享地图前移除其中的私密元素时。就我们所知，这是首个针对该问题展开研究的工作。
为解答这一问题，我们提出了一种定量评估方法，用以测量移除操作是否留下了可被感知或推断的物体残留物。当此类残留存在时，场景即不再具备隐私性。我们在多种最先进的场景表示方法上进行了实验，结果表明我们提出的指标具有显著意义，并与我们开展的用户研究结果高度一致。此外，我们还提出了一种基于空间一致性与语义一致性的残留精修方法，以进一步优化元素移除效果。
