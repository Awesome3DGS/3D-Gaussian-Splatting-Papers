### OmniPhysGS: 3D Constitutive Gaussians for General Physics-Based Dynamics Generation

Recently, significant advancements have been made in the reconstruction and generation of 3D assets, including static cases and those with physical interactions. To recover the physical properties of 3D assets, existing methods typically assume that all materials belong to a specific predefined category (e.g., elasticity). However, such assumptions ignore the complex composition of multiple heterogeneous objects in real scenarios and tend to render less physically plausible animation given a wider range of objects. We propose OmniPhysGS for synthesizing a physics-based 3D dynamic scene composed of more general objects. A key design of OmniPhysGS is treating each 3D asset as a collection of constitutive 3D Gaussians. For each Gaussian, its physical material is represented by an ensemble of 12 physical domain-expert sub-models (rubber, metal, honey, water, etc.), which greatly enhances the flexibility of the proposed model. In the implementation, we define a scene by user-specified prompts and supervise the estimation of material weighting factors via a pretrained video diffusion model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPhysGS achieves more general and realistic physical dynamics across a broader spectrum of materials, including elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, and fluid substances, as well as interactions between different materials. Our method surpasses existing methods by approximately 3% to 16% in metrics of visual quality and text alignment.

近期，在 3D 资产的重建和生成方面取得了显著进展，包括静态场景和具有物理交互的动态场景。为了恢复 3D 资产的物理属性，现有方法通常假设所有材料属于某个特定的预定义类别（如弹性）。然而，这种假设忽略了现实场景中多种异质物体的复杂组成，且在处理更广泛物体时，可能导致动画效果在物理上不够逼真。为此，我们提出了 OmniPhysGS，用于合成一个基于物理的 3D 动态场景，能够包含更多一般性的物体。OmniPhysGS 的一个关键设计是将每个 3D 资产视为一组构成的 3D 高斯点。对于每个高斯点，其物理材料通过 12 个物理领域专家子模型（如橡胶、金属、蜂蜜、水等）的集合来表示，这大大增强了模型的灵活性。在实现过程中，我们通过用户指定的提示定义场景，并通过预训练的视频扩散模型来监督材料加权因子的估计。综合实验表明，OmniPhysGS 在包括弹性、粘弹性、塑性、流体等物质的多种材料及其交互作用下，能够实现更广泛且更逼真的物理动态。与现有方法相比，我们的方法在视觉质量和文本对齐度的指标上提升了约 3% 至 16%。
