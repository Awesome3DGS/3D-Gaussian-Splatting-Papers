### Proc-GS: Procedural Building Generation for City Assembly with 3D Gaussians

Buildings are primary components of cities, often featuring repeated elements such as windows and doors. Traditional 3D building asset creation is labor-intensive and requires specialized skills to develop design rules. Recent generative models for building creation often overlook these patterns, leading to low visual fidelity and limited scalability. Drawing inspiration from procedural modeling techniques used in the gaming and visual effects industry, our method, Proc-GS, integrates procedural code into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) framework, leveraging their advantages in high-fidelity rendering and efficient asset management from both worlds. By manipulating procedural code, we can streamline this process and generate an infinite variety of buildings. This integration significantly reduces model size by utilizing shared foundational assets, enabling scalable generation with precise control over building assembly. We showcase the potential for expansive cityscape generation while maintaining high rendering fidelity and precise control on both real and synthetic cases.

建筑物是城市的主要组成部分，通常包含重复的元素，例如窗户和门。传统的3D建筑资产创建过程劳动密集，且需要专业技能来制定设计规则。近年来的生成模型在建筑生成方面往往忽略了这些重复模式，导致视觉保真度较低且扩展性有限。
受游戏和视觉特效行业中程序化建模技术的启发，我们提出了 Proc-GS 方法，将程序化代码集成到 3D 高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3D-GS）框架中，结合两者在高保真渲染和高效资产管理上的优势。通过操作程序化代码，我们能够简化建筑生成过程，同时生成无限多样化的建筑。
这一集成通过利用共享的基础资产显著减少了模型大小，从而实现可扩展的生成，并对建筑装配提供精确控制。我们展示了在真实与合成场景中扩展城市景观生成的潜力，同时保持高渲染保真度与精确控制。
