### DeferredGS: Decoupled and Editable Gaussian Splatting with Deferred Shading

Reconstructing and editing 3D objects and scenes both play crucial roles in computer graphics and computer vision. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can achieve realistic reconstruction and editing results but suffer from inefficiency in rendering. Gaussian splatting significantly accelerates rendering by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids. However, Gaussian splatting utilizes a single Spherical Harmonic (SH) function to model both texture and lighting, limiting independent editing capabilities of these components. Recently, attempts have been made to decouple texture and lighting with the Gaussian splatting representation but may fail to produce plausible geometry and decomposition results on reflective scenes. Additionally, the forward shading technique they employ introduces noticeable blending artifacts during relighting, as the geometry attributes of Gaussians are optimized under the original illumination and may not be suitable for novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we introduce DeferredGS, a method for decoupling and editing the Gaussian splatting representation using deferred shading. To achieve successful decoupling, we model the illumination with a learnable environment map and define additional attributes such as texture parameters and normal direction on Gaussians, where the normal is distilled from a jointly trained signed distance function. More importantly, we apply deferred shading, resulting in more realistic relighting effects compared to previous methods. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeferredGS in novel view synthesis and editing tasks.

在计算机图形学和计算机视觉领域，重建和编辑3D对象及场景都扮演着关键角色。神经辐射场（NeRFs）能够实现真实的重建和编辑结果，但在渲染效率上存在不足。高斯飞溅通过光栅化高斯椭球体显著加速了渲染。然而，高斯飞溅使用单一的球谐函数（SH）来同时模拟纹理和光照，限制了这些组成部分的独立编辑能力。最近，已经有尝试使用高斯飞溅表现形式解耦纹理和光照，但在反射场景上可能无法生成可信的几何和分解结果。此外，他们采用的正向着色技术在重新照明时引入了明显的混合伪影，因为高斯的几何属性是在原始照明下优化的，可能不适用于新的照明条件。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了DeferredGS方法，使用延迟着色来解耦和编辑高斯飞溅表现形式。为了实现成功的解耦，我们使用可学习的环境映射来模拟照明，并在高斯上定义额外属性，如纹理参数和法线方向，其中法线是从共同训练的有符号距离函数中提取的。更重要的是，我们应用了延迟着色，与以往方法相比，实现了更真实的重新照明效果。定性和定量实验均证明了DeferredGS在新视角合成和编辑任务中的卓越性能。
