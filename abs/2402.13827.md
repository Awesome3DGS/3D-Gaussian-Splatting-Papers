### Identifying Unnecessary 3D Gaussians using Clustering for Fast Rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) is a new rendering approach that outperforms the neural radiance field (NeRF) in terms of both speed and image quality. 3D-GS represents 3D scenes by utilizing millions of 3D Gaussians and projects these Gaussians onto the 2D image plane for rendering. However, during the rendering process, a substantial number of unnecessary 3D Gaussians exist for the current view direction, resulting in significant computation costs associated with their identification. In this paper, we propose a computational reduction technique that quickly identifies unnecessary 3D Gaussians in real-time for rendering the current view without compromising image quality. This is accomplished through the offline clustering of 3D Gaussians that are close in distance, followed by the projection of these clusters onto a 2D image plane during runtime. Additionally, we analyze the bottleneck associated with the proposed technique when executed on GPUs and propose an efficient hardware architecture that seamlessly supports the proposed scheme. For the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, the proposed technique excludes 63% of 3D Gaussians on average before the 2D image projection, which reduces the overall rendering computation by almost 38.3% without sacrificing peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR). The proposed accelerator also achieves a speedup of 10.7x compared to a GPU.

三维高斯喷溅（3D-GS）是一种新的渲染方法，无论是速度还是图像质量，都优于神经辐射场（NeRF）。3D-GS通过利用数以百万计的三维高斯来表示三维场景，并将这些高斯投影到二维图像平面上进行渲染。然而，在渲染过程中，对于当前视图方向而言，存在大量不必要的三维高斯，这导致了与它们的识别相关的显著计算成本。在本文中，我们提出了一种计算降低技术，该技术能够在不损害图像质量的情况下，实时快速识别出渲染当前视图时不必要的三维高斯。这通过离线聚类那些距离接近的三维高斯，然后在运行时将这些簇投影到二维图像平面上来实现。此外，我们分析了在GPU上执行时与所提技术相关的瓶颈，并提出了一种高效的硬件架构，无缝支持所提方案。对于Mip-NeRF360数据集，所提技术平均排除了63%的三维高斯在二维图像投影之前，这减少了将近38.3%的总体渲染计算量，同时不牺牲峰值信噪比（PSNR）。所提出的加速器还实现了相比GPU 10.7倍的加速。
