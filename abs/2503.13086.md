### Gaussian On-the-Fly Splatting: A Progressive Framework for Robust Near Real-Time 3DGS Optimization

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves high-fidelity rendering with fast real-time performance, but existing methods rely on offline training after full Structure-from-Motion (SfM) processing. In contrast, this work introduces On-the-Fly GS, a progressive framework enabling near real-time 3DGS optimization during image capture. As each image arrives, its pose and sparse points are updated via on-the-fly SfM, and newly optimized Gaussians are immediately integrated into the 3DGS field. We propose a progressive local optimization strategy to prioritize new images and their neighbors by their corresponding overlapping relationship, allowing the new image and its overlapping images to get more training. To further stabilize training across old and new images, an adaptive learning rate schedule balances the iterations and the learning rate. Moreover, to maintain overall quality of the 3DGS field, an efficient global optimization scheme prevents overfitting to the newly added images. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our On-the-Fly GS reduces training time significantly, optimizing each new image in seconds with minimal rendering loss, offering the first practical step toward rapid, progressive 3DGS reconstruction.

三维高斯点云渲染（3DGS）实现了高保真渲染和快速的实时性能，但现有方法依赖于在完整的运动结构（SfM）处理后进行离线训练。与此不同，本文提出了On-the-Fly GS，一种渐进式框架，能够在图像捕捉过程中实现近实时的3DGS优化。随着每张图像的到来，其姿态和稀疏点通过实时SfM进行更新，优化后的高斯点立即集成到3DGS场中。我们提出了一种渐进式局部优化策略，通过对应的重叠关系来优先处理新图像及其邻域，使新图像及其重叠图像能获得更多的训练。为了进一步稳定旧图像和新图像的训练过程，我们采用了自适应学习率调度，平衡迭代次数和学习率。此外，为了保持3DGS场的整体质量，我们设计了一种高效的全局优化方案，防止过拟合到新加入的图像。多个基准数据集上的实验表明，我们的On-the-Fly GS显著减少了训练时间，能够在几秒钟内优化每张新图像，同时保持最小的渲染损失，为快速、渐进式3DGS重建迈出了实际的第一步。
