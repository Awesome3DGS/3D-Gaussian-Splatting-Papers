### Advancing Extended Reality with 3D Gaussian Splatting: Innovations and Prospects

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted significant attention for its potential to revolutionize 3D representation, rendering, and interaction. Despite the rapid growth of 3DGS research, its direct application to Extended Reality (XR) remains underexplored. Although many studies recognize the potential of 3DGS for XR, few have explicitly focused on or demonstrated its effectiveness within XR environments. In this paper, we aim to synthesize innovations in 3DGS that show specific potential for advancing XR research and development. We conduct a comprehensive review of publicly available 3DGS papers, with a focus on those referencing XR-related concepts. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of innovations explicitly relevant to XR and propose a taxonomy to highlight their significance. Building on these insights, we propose several prospective XR research areas where 3DGS can make promising contributions, yet remain rarely touched. By investigating the intersection of 3DGS and XR, this paper provides a roadmap to push the boundaries of XR using cutting-edge 3DGS techniques.

3D高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）因其在革新3D表示、渲染和交互方面的潜力而备受关注。尽管3DGS研究发展迅速，其在扩展现实（Extended Reality, XR）中的直接应用仍然鲜有探讨。虽然许多研究认识到3DGS在XR领域的潜力，但明确专注于XR环境中验证其有效性的研究却较少。在本文中，我们旨在整合3DGS领域内具有推动XR研究与开发潜力的创新点。我们对公开发表的3DGS论文进行了全面回顾，特别关注那些提及XR相关概念的研究。此外，我们深入分析了与XR明确相关的创新，并提出一个分类法以突出其重要性。在此基础上，我们提出了一些3DGS在XR中可发挥重要作用但鲜有涉足的潜在研究方向。通过探讨3DGS与XR的交集，本文为利用尖端3DGS技术推动XR发展提供了一条清晰的路线图。
