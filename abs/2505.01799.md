### AquaGS: Fast Underwater Scene Reconstruction with SfM-Free Gaussian Splatting

Underwater scene reconstruction is a critical tech-nology for underwater operations, enabling the generation of 3D models from images captured by underwater platforms. However, the quality of underwater images is often degraded due to medium interference, which limits the effectiveness of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose estimation, leading to subsequent reconstruction failures. Additionally, SfM methods typically operate at slower speeds, further hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce AquaGS, an SfM-free underwater scene reconstruction model based on the SeaThru algorithm, which facilitates rapid and accurate separation of scene details and medium features. Our approach initializes Gaussians by integrating state-of-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS) technology, employs implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for rendering translucent media and utilizes the latest explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render object surfaces, which effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods and accurately simulates underwater optical phenomena. Experimental results on the data set and the robot platform show that our model can complete high-precision reconstruction in 30 seconds with only 3 image inputs, significantly enhancing the practical application of the algorithm in robotic platforms.

水下场景重建是水下作业中的关键技术，能够利用水下平台采集的图像生成三维模型。然而，由于介质干扰的影响，水下图像质量常常受到严重退化，限制了基于结构光束法（Structure-from-Motion, SfM）的位姿估计效果，进而导致后续重建失败。此外，SfM 方法本身运行速度较慢，也进一步制约了其在实时场景中的适用性。
本文提出 AquaGS，一种无需 SfM 的水下场景重建模型，基于 SeaThru 算法实现场景细节与介质特征的快速且精确的分离。我们的方法结合了最先进的多视图立体（Multi-view Stereo, MVS）技术初始化高斯分布，利用隐式神经辐射场（NeRF）渲染半透明介质，并采用最新的显式三维高斯泼溅（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）技术渲染物体表面，有效克服传统方法的局限，真实模拟了水下光学现象。
在公开数据集和机器人平台上的实验结果表明，我们的模型仅需 3 张图像输入，即可在 30 秒内完成高精度重建，显著提升了算法在机器人平台中的实际应用价值。
