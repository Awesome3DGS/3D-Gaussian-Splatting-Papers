### Texture-GS: Disentangling the Geometry and Texture for 3D Gaussian Splatting Editing

3D Gaussian splatting, emerging as a groundbreaking approach, has drawn increasing attention for its capabilities of high-fidelity reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, it couples the appearance and geometry of the scene within the Gaussian attributes, which hinders the flexibility of editing operations, such as texture swapping. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, namely Texture-GS, to disentangle the appearance from the geometry by representing it as a 2D texture mapped onto the 3D surface, thereby facilitating appearance editing. Technically, the disentanglement is achieved by our proposed texture mapping module, which consists of a UV mapping MLP to learn the UV coordinates for the 3D Gaussian centers, a local Taylor expansion of the MLP to efficiently approximate the UV coordinates for the ray-Gaussian intersections, and a learnable texture to capture the fine-grained appearance. Extensive experiments on the DTU dataset demonstrate that our method not only facilitates high-fidelity appearance editing but also achieves real-time rendering on consumer-level devices, e.g. a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

3D高斯溅射作为一种开创性的方法，因其高保真重建和实时渲染的能力而受到越来越多的关注。然而，它将场景的外观和几何属性耦合在高斯属性中，这限制了编辑操作的灵活性，比如纹理交换。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，即Texture-GS，通过将外观表示为映射到3D表面上的2D纹理，从而实现外观和几何的分离，进而便于外观编辑。技术上，分离是通过我们提出的纹理映射模块实现的，该模块包括一个UV映射MLP来学习3D高斯中心的UV坐标，MLP的局部泰勒展开来高效近似射线-高斯交点的UV坐标，以及一个可学习的纹理来捕捉细粒度外观。在DTU数据集上的广泛实验表明，我们的方法不仅便于高保真外观编辑，而且还实现了在消费级设备上的实时渲染，例如单个RTX 2080 Ti GPU。
