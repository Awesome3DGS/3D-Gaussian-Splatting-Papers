### Gaussian Pancakes: Geometrically-Regularized 3D Gaussian Splatting for Realistic Endoscopic Reconstruction

Within colorectal cancer diagnostics, conventional colonoscopy techniques face critical limitations, including a limited field of view and a lack of depth information, which can impede the detection of precancerous lesions. Current methods struggle to provide comprehensive and accurate 3D reconstructions of the colonic surface which can help minimize the missing regions and reinspection for pre-cancerous polyps. Addressing this, we introduce 'Gaussian Pancakes', a method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) combined with a Recurrent Neural Network-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (RNNSLAM) system. By introducing geometric and depth regularization into the 3D GS framework, our approach ensures more accurate alignment of Gaussians with the colon surface, resulting in smoother 3D reconstructions with novel viewing of detailed textures and structures. Evaluations across three diverse datasets show that Gaussian Pancakes enhances novel view synthesis quality, surpassing current leading methods with a 18% boost in PSNR and a 16% improvement in SSIM. It also delivers over 100X faster rendering and more than 10X shorter training times, making it a practical tool for real-time applications. Hence, this holds promise for achieving clinical translation for better detection and diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

在结直肠癌诊断中，传统的结肠镜技术面临关键限制，包括有限的视野和缺乏深度信息，这可能阻碍了癌前病变检测。当前方法难以提供全面准确的结肠表面3D重建，这有助于最小化遗漏区域和对癌前息肉的重新检查。针对这一问题，我们引入了“高斯煎饼”，一种方法，它结合了3D高斯喷涂（3D GS）和基于递归神经网络的同时定位与建图（RNNSLAM）系统。通过在3D GS框架中引入几何和深度正则化，我们的方法确保了高斯与结肠表面的更准确对齐，结果在查看详细纹理和结构时产生了更平滑的3D重建。在三个不同数据集上的评估显示，“高斯煎饼”提高了新视图合成质量，与当前领先方法相比，PSNR提高了18%，SSIM提高了16%。它还实现了超过100倍的渲染速度和超过10倍的训练时间缩短，使其成为实时应用的实用工具。因此，这为实现临床转化以更好地检测和诊断结直肠癌提供了希望。
