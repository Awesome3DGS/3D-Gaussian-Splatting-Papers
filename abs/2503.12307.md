### Swift4D:Adaptive divide-and-conquer Gaussian Splatting for compact and efficient reconstruction of dynamic scene

Novel view synthesis has long been a practical but challenging task, although the introduction of numerous methods to solve this problem, even combining advanced representations like 3D Gaussian Splatting, they still struggle to recover high-quality results and often consume too much storage memory and training time. In this paper we propose Swift4D, a divide-and-conquer 3D Gaussian Splatting method that can handle static and dynamic primitives separately, achieving a good trade-off between rendering quality and efficiency, motivated by the fact that most of the scene is the static primitive and does not require additional dynamic properties. Concretely, we focus on modeling dynamic transformations only for the dynamic primitives which benefits both efficiency and quality. We first employ a learnable decomposition strategy to separate the primitives, which relies on an additional parameter to classify primitives as static or dynamic. For the dynamic primitives, we employ a compact multi-resolution 4D Hash mapper to transform these primitives from canonical space into deformation space at each timestamp, and then mix the static and dynamic primitives to produce the final output. This divide-and-conquer method facilitates efficient training and reduces storage redundancy. Our method not only achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while being 20X faster in training than previous SOTA methods with a minimum storage requirement of only 30MB on real-world datasets.

新颖视角合成一直是一个实用但具有挑战性的任务，尽管已有许多方法试图解决这一问题，甚至结合了像三维高斯点云渲染（3D Gaussian Splatting）这样的先进表示，但它们仍然难以恢复高质量的结果，且往往消耗过多的存储内存和训练时间。本文提出了Swift4D，一种分治的三维高斯点云渲染方法，可以分别处理静态和动态原语，在渲染质量和效率之间实现良好的平衡，灵感来源于大部分场景是静态原语，不需要额外的动态属性。具体来说，我们仅针对动态原语建模动态变换，这对效率和质量都有好处。我们首先采用一种可学习的分解策略，将原语分离开来，该策略依赖于额外的参数将原语分类为静态或动态。对于动态原语，我们使用紧凑的多分辨率4D哈希映射器，将这些原语从规范空间转换到变形空间，并在每个时间戳下进行处理，之后将静态和动态原语混合，生成最终输出。这种分治方法促进了高效的训练，并减少了存储冗余。我们的方法不仅实现了最先进的渲染质量，而且在训练速度上比以往的SOTA方法快20倍，并且在实际数据集上仅需30MB的最低存储需求。
