### SemanticGarment: Semantic-Controlled Generation and Editing of 3D Gaussian Garments

3D digital garment generation and editing play a pivotal role in fashion design, virtual try-on, and gaming. Traditional methods struggle to meet the growing demand due to technical complexity and high resource costs. Learning-based approaches offer faster, more diverse garment synthesis based on specific requirements and reduce human efforts and time costs. However, they still face challenges such as inconsistent multi-view geometry or textures and heavy reliance on detailed garment topology and manual rigging. We propose SemanticGarment, a 3D Gaussian-based method that realizes high-fidelity 3D garment generation from text or image prompts and supports semantic-based interactive editing for flexible user customization. To ensure multi-view consistency and garment fitting, we propose to leverage structural human priors for the generative model by introducing a 3D semantic clothing model, which initializes the geometry structure and lays the groundwork for view-consistent garment generation and editing. Without the need to regenerate or rely on existing mesh templates, our approach allows for rapid and diverse modifications to existing Gaussians, either globally or within a local region. To address the artifacts caused by self-occlusion for garment reconstruction based on single image, we develop a self-occlusion optimization strategy to mitigate holes and artifacts that arise when directly animating self-occluded garments. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate our superior performance in 3D garment generation and editing.

三维数字服装的生成与编辑在时尚设计、虚拟试衣和游戏领域中发挥着关键作用。传统方法由于技术复杂度高、资源消耗大，难以满足日益增长的需求。基于学习的方法能够根据特定需求实现更快速、更丰富的服装生成，从而显著减少人工成本和时间开销。然而，这类方法仍面临诸如多视角几何与纹理不一致、对精细服装拓扑及手动绑定的高度依赖等问题。为此，我们提出了 **SemanticGarment**——一种基于三维高斯（3D Gaussian）的高保真服装生成与语义可交互编辑方法。该方法能够根据文本或图像提示生成高质量的三维服装，并支持语义驱动的灵活用户自定义编辑。为保证多视一致性与服装贴合性，我们在生成模型中引入了结构化人体先验，通过构建三维语义服装模型来初始化几何结构，为多视一致的服装生成与编辑奠定基础。我们的方案无需重新生成或依赖现有网格模板，即可对已有高斯表示进行快速、多样的全局或局部修改。针对单张图像驱动的服装重建中因自遮挡带来的伪影问题，我们提出了自遮挡优化策略，有效缓解在直接动画化自遮挡服装时出现的空洞与伪影。大量实验验证了 SemanticGarment 在三维服装生成与编辑任务中的卓越性能。
