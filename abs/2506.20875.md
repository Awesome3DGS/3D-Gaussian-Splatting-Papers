### 3DGH: 3D Head Generation with Composable Hair and Face

We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing.

我们提出了 3DGH，一种用于三维人头生成的无条件生成模型，支持头发与面部组件的可组合建模。不同于以往将头发与面部混合建模的方式，我们采用基于模板的三维高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting）引入了一种全新的数据表示方法，将两者分离，并在其中引入可变形的头发几何结构以捕捉不同发型之间的几何差异。在该数据表示基础上，我们设计了一种基于三维 GAN 的网络结构，采用双生成器架构，并引入交叉注意力机制以建模头发与面部之间的内在关联。该模型基于合成渲染数据进行训练，并结合精心设计的目标函数以稳定训练过程并促进头发与面部的有效分离。我们进行了大量实验来验证 3DGH 的设计选择，并通过与多种先进的三维 GAN 方法进行定性与定量比较，展示了其在无条件全头图像合成与可组合三维发型编辑方面的有效性。
