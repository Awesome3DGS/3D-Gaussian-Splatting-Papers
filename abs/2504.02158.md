### UAVTwin: Neural Digital Twins for UAVs using Gaussian Splatting

We present UAVTwin, a method for creating digital twins from real-world environments and facilitating data augmentation for training downstream models embedded in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, our approach focuses on synthesizing foreground components, such as various human instances in motion within complex scene backgrounds, from UAV perspectives. This is achieved by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing backgrounds along with controllable synthetic human models that display diverse appearances and actions in multiple poses. To the best of our knowledge, UAVTwin is the first approach for UAV-based perception that is capable of generating high-fidelity digital twins based on 3DGS. The proposed work significantly enhances downstream models through data augmentation for real-world environments with multiple dynamic objects and significant appearance variations-both of which typically introduce artifacts in 3DGS-based modeling. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel appearance modeling strategy and a mask refinement module to enhance the training of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We demonstrate the high quality of neural rendering by achieving a 1.23 dB improvement in PSNR compared to recent methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of data augmentation by showing a 2.5% to 13.7% improvement in mAP for the human detection task.

我们提出 UAVTwin，一种用于从真实环境中构建数字孪生体，并为无人机（UAV）中嵌入的下游模型提供数据增强的方法。该方法特别关注从无人机视角合成前景要素，例如在复杂场景背景中运动的人体实例。
UAVTwin 通过结合三维高斯喷洒（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）对背景进行重建，并引入可控的合成人体模型，以多样的外观、动作与姿态呈现，完成对真实环境的仿真。我们的方法是目前首个基于 3DGS 构建高保真数字孪生体并服务于无人机感知任务的方案。
本研究显著提升了下游模型在包含多个动态物体与显著外观变化的现实场景中的表现，而这类因素通常会对基于 3DGS 的建模造成伪影。为解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新的外观建模策略以及一个掩码细化模块，用于提升 3DGS 训练过程中的建模质量。
在神经渲染效果方面，我们在 PSNR 上相比最新方法提升 1.23 dB；在数据增强效能方面，我们在人类检测任务中实现了 2.5% 至 13.7% 的 mAP 提升，验证了该方法在下游任务中的实际价值。
