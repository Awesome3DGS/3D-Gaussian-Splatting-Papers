### 3DGAA: Realistic and Robust 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack for Autonomous Driving

Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world environments. Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.

基于摄像头的目标检测系统在自动驾驶中发挥着至关重要的作用，但在真实环境中仍易受到对抗性威胁的影响。现有的二维与三维物理攻击由于侧重于纹理优化，往往难以在物理真实感与攻击鲁棒性之间取得平衡。本文提出了一种新的对抗性物体生成框架——基于三维高斯的对抗性攻击（3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack, 3DGAA），利用三维高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）的全 14 维参数化方式，在物理可实现的条件下联合优化几何与外观。与依赖贴片或纹理优化的先前方法不同，3DGAA 同时扰动几何属性（形状、尺度、旋转）与外观属性（颜色、不透明度），生成具有物理真实感且可迁移的对抗性物体。我们进一步引入了物理过滤模块（physical filtering module）以剔除异常值、保持几何保真度，并设计了物理增强模块（physical augmentation module）以模拟复杂的物理场景，从而提升攻击在真实世界条件下的泛化能力。我们在虚拟基准测试与使用微缩车辆模型的真实物理环境中对 3DGAA 进行了评估，实验结果表明，该方法可将检测 mAP 从 87.21% 降至 7.38%，显著优于现有三维物理攻击。此外，我们的方法在不同物理条件下保持了较高的可迁移性，在物理可实现的对抗性攻击领域达到了新的最先进水平。
