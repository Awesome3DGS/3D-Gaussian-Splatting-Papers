### DreamPolisher: Towards High-Quality Text-to-3D Generation via Geometric Diffusion

We present DreamPolisher, a novel Gaussian Splatting based method with geometric guidance, tailored to learn cross-view consistency and intricate detail from textual descriptions. While recent progress on text-to-3D generation methods have been promising, prevailing methods often fail to ensure view-consistency and textural richness. This problem becomes particularly noticeable for methods that work with text input alone. To address this, we propose a two-stage Gaussian Splatting based approach that enforces geometric consistency among views. Initially, a coarse 3D generation undergoes refinement via geometric optimization. Subsequently, we use a ControlNet driven refiner coupled with the geometric consistency term to improve both texture fidelity and overall consistency of the generated 3D asset. Empirical evaluations across diverse textual prompts spanning various object categories demonstrate the efficacy of DreamPolisher in generating consistent and realistic 3D objects, aligning closely with the semantics of the textual instructions.

我们介绍了DreamPolisher，一种基于高斯Splatting的新方法，它采用几何引导，专为从文本描述中学习跨视图一致性和复杂细节而设计。虽然最近在文本到三维生成方法上的进展令人鼓舞，但现有方法常常无法确保视图一致性和纹理丰富性。这一问题对仅与文本输入工作的方法尤为明显。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于两阶段高斯Splatting的方法，该方法强制执行视图间的几何一致性。最初，通过几何优化对粗糙的三维生成进行精炼。随后，我们使用一个由ControlNet驱动的细化器，结合几何一致性项，来改善生成的三维资产的纹理保真度和整体一致性。跨多个对象类别的多样文本提示的经验评估证明了DreamPolisher在生成与文本指令语义紧密对齐的一致和现实的三维对象方面的有效性。
