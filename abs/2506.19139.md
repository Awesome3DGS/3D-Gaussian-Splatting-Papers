### SOF: Sorted Opacity Fields for Fast Unbounded Surface Reconstruction

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments - remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude. As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

三维高斯表示的最新进展显著提升了基于图像的场景重建的质量与效率。其显式特性有助于实现实时渲染和快速优化，但在大规模、无边界环境中提取精确表面仍是一项挑战。许多现有方法依赖于近似深度估计和全局排序启发式算法，这可能导致伪影的产生，并限制重建网格的保真度。本文提出了**排序不透明度场（Sorted Opacity Fields, SOF）**方法，旨在以高速度和高精度从三维高斯中恢复细致表面。我们的方法通过引入**分层重排序机制**和更稳健的高斯深度建模（更好地对齐 level-set）来改进现有工作。为提升网格质量，我们在不透明度场上引入 level-set 正则项，并设计了促进几何一致性原始形状的损失函数。此外，我们还开发了一种并行化的 Marching Tetrahedra 算法，专为我们的不透明度建模设计，其网格生成时间最多可减少一个数量级。定量评估表明，SOF 实现了更高的重建精度，同时总处理时间减少超过三倍。这些成果推动了从高效的高斯渲染迈向同样高效的几何提取。
