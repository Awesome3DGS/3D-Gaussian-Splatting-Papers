### 3D Gaussian Model for Animation and Texturing

3D Gaussian Splatting has made a marked impact on neural rendering by achieving impressive fidelity and performance. Despite this achievement, however, it is not readily applicable to developing interactive applications. Real-time applications like XR apps and games require functions such as animation, UV-mapping, and model editing simultaneously manipulated through the usage of a 3D model. We propose a modeling that is analogous to typical 3D models, which we call 3D Gaussian Model (3DGM); it provides a manipulatable proxy for novel animation and texture transfer. By binding the 3D Gaussians in texture space and re-projecting them back to world space through implicit shell mapping, we show how our 3D modeling can serve as a valid rendering methodology for interactive applications. It is further noted that recently, 3D mesh reconstruction works have been able to produce high-quality mesh for rendering. Our work, on the other hand, only requires an approximated geometry for rendering an object in high fidelity. Applicationwise, we will show that our proxy-based 3DGM is capable of driving novel animation without animated training data and texture transferring via UV mapping of the 3D Gaussians. We believe the result indicates the potential of our work for enabling interactive applications for 3D Gaussian Splatting.

3D高斯喷溅在神经渲染领域取得了显著影响，实现了令人印象深刻的保真度和性能。尽管取得了这一成就，但它并不容易直接应用于开发交互式应用程序。像XR应用和游戏这样的实时应用需要同时通过使用3D模型操作动画、UV映射和模型编辑等功能。我们提出了一种类似于典型3D模型的建模方法，我们称之为3D高斯模型（3DGM）；它提供了一个可操作的代理，用于新颖的动画和纹理转移。通过将3D高斯绑定在纹理空间，并通过隐式壳层映射重新投影回世界空间，我们展示了我们的3D建模如何作为交互式应用的有效渲染方法论。还应注意的是，最近的3D网格重建工作已经能够生成高质量的网格用于渲染。另一方面，我们的工作只需要一个近似的几何形状就可以高保真度地渲染对象。应用方面，我们将展示我们基于代理的3DGM能够驱动新颖的动画，无需动画训练数据，以及通过3D高斯的UV映射实现纹理转移。我们相信这一结果表明了我们的工作为3D高斯喷溅启用交互式应用的潜力。
