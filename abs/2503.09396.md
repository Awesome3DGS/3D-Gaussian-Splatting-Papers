### Close-up-GS: Enhancing Close-Up View Synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting with Progressive Self-Training

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing novel views after training on a given set of viewpoints. However, its rendering quality deteriorates when the synthesized view deviates significantly from the training views. This decline occurs due to (1) the model's difficulty in generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios and (2) challenges in interpolating fine details caused by substantial resolution changes and occlusions. A notable case of this limitation is close-up view generation--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than those in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach for close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model with self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas. First, we leverage the See3D model, a recently introduced 3D-aware generative model, to enhance the details of rendered views. Second, we propose a strategy to progressively expand the "trust regions" of the 3DGS model and update a set of reference views for See3D. Finally, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy to carefully update the 3DGS model with training data generated from the above schemes. We further define metrics for close-up views evaluation to facilitate better research on this problem. By conducting evaluations on specifically selected scenarios for close-up views, our proposed approach demonstrates a clear advantage over competitive solutions.

3D 高斯散点 (3DGS) 在对给定视点集进行训练后，已展现出卓越的新视图合成性能。然而，当合成视图与训练视图存在较大偏差时，其渲染质量会显著下降。这一退化主要归因于 (1) 该模型难以泛化到分布外（out-of-distribution）场景，以及 (2) 由于分辨率变化和遮挡严重，细节插值变得更加困难。其中一个典型的限制案例是近景视图生成——即生成比训练集中视点更接近物体的视图。
为解决这一问题，我们提出了一种基于逐步训练 3DGS 模型的自生成数据的新方法。我们的方案基于三个关键思想。首先，我们利用 See3D 模型，这是一种新近提出的 3D 感知生成模型，以增强渲染视图的细节。其次，我们提出了一种策略，以逐步扩展 3DGS 模型的“信任区域”，并更新 See3D 的一组参考视图。最后，我们引入了一种精细微调策略，以利用上述方案生成的训练数据谨慎地更新 3DGS 模型。我们进一步定义了近景视图评估的度量标准，以促进对该问题的深入研究。通过在特定的近景视图场景中进行评估，我们的方法在竞争性解决方案中展现出明显的优势。
