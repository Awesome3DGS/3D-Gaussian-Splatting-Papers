### 3D Gaussian Splatting with Deferred Reflection

The advent of neural and Gaussian-based radiance field methods have achieved great success in the field of novel view synthesis. However, specular reflection remains non-trivial, as the high frequency radiance field is notoriously difficult to fit stably and accurately. We present a deferred shading method to effectively render specular reflection with Gaussian splatting. The key challenge comes from the environment map reflection model, which requires accurate surface normal while simultaneously bottlenecks normal estimation with discontinuous gradients. We leverage the per-pixel reflection gradients generated by deferred shading to bridge the optimization process of neighboring Gaussians, allowing nearly correct normal estimations to gradually propagate and eventually spread over all reflective objects. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and concurrent work in synthesizing high-quality specular reflection effects, demonstrating a consistent improvement of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for both synthetic and real-world scenes, while running at a frame rate almost identical to vanilla Gaussian splatting.

神经网络和基于高斯的辐射场方法的出现在新视角合成领域取得了巨大成功。然而，镜面反射的处理仍然非常棘手，因为高频辐射场的拟合稳定性和准确性众所周知是非常困难的。我们提出了一种延迟着色方法，有效地使用高斯喷溅渲染镜面反射。主要挑战来自环境映射反射模型，这需要精确的表面法线，同时在具有不连续梯度的情况下阻碍法线估计。我们利用延迟着色生成的每像素反射梯度来桥接邻近高斯的优化过程，允许几乎正确的法线估计逐渐传播，并最终扩展到所有反射对象上。我们的方法显著优于最先进技术和同时期的工作，在合成高质量镜面反射效果方面展示了一致的峰值信噪比（PSNR）改进，适用于合成场景和现实世界场景，同时运行帧率几乎与普通高斯喷溅相同。
