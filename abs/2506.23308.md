### Endo-4DGX: Robust Endoscopic Scene Reconstruction and Illumination Correction with Gaussian Splatting

Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure. Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments, underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications.

软组织的精确重建对于推进图像引导的机器人手术自动化具有关键意义。近年来，三维高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）及其扩展方法 4DGS 已能够实现动态手术场景的实时高质量渲染。然而，3DGS 类方法在光照变化剧烈的场景中仍表现不佳，如低照度和过曝环境。在这些极端光照条件下训练 3DGS 会导致严重的优化难题和极差的渲染质量。为应对这一挑战，我们提出 **Endo-4DGX**，一种专为内窥镜场景中非均匀照明设计的光照自适应高斯投影重建方法。通过引入**光照嵌入向量**，我们的方法能够有效建模视角相关的亮度变化；我们还设计了**区域感知增强模块**，在高斯级别对子区域亮度进行建模；以及**空间感知调整模块**，学习视角一致的亮度调节策略。得益于光照自适应机制，Endo-4DGX 在低照度与过曝条件下均可实现优异的渲染效果，同时保持几何重建的准确性。此外，我们还引入了**曝光控制损失**，用于将不良曝光下的外观恢复至正常状态，从而实现更鲁棒的光照自适应优化。实验结果表明，在光照极端变化的环境下，Endo-4DGX 显著优于当前最先进的重建与图像恢复方法的组合，展示了其在机器人辅助手术应用中的巨大潜力。
