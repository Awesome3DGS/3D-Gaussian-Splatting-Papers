### GS-2DGS: Geometrically Supervised 2DGS for Reflective Object Reconstruction

3D modeling of highly reflective objects remains challenging due to strong view-dependent appearances. While previous SDF-based methods can recover high-quality meshes, they are often time-consuming and tend to produce over-smoothed surfaces. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers the advantage of high speed and detailed real-time rendering, but extracting surfaces from the Gaussians can be noisy due to the lack of geometric constraints. To bridge the gap between these approaches, we propose a novel reconstruction method called GS-2DGS for reflective objects based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Our approach combines the rapid rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting with additional geometric information from foundation models. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms Gaussian-based techniques in terms of reconstruction and relighting and achieves performance comparable to SDF-based methods while being an order of magnitude faster.

高反射物体的三维建模因其强烈的视角依赖性外观而依然充满挑战。尽管以往基于 SDF 的方法能够恢复高质量网格，但它们通常耗时较长且容易生成过于平滑的表面。相比之下，三维高斯溅射（3DGS）具有高速与细节丰富的实时渲染优势，但由于缺乏几何约束，从高斯中提取表面往往会产生噪声。为弥合这两类方法之间的差距，我们提出了一种基于二维高斯溅射（2DGS）的新型高反射物体重建方法 **GS-2DGS**。该方法结合了高斯溅射的快速渲染能力与来自基础模型的额外几何信息。在合成与真实数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法在重建与重光照效果方面显著优于基于高斯的技术，并在性能上可与基于 SDF 的方法相媲美，同时速度快了一个数量级。
