### Aerial-Ground Image Feature Matching via 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Intermediate View Rendering

The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in 3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based scene rendering.

融合航拍图像与地面图像已成为复杂场景三维建模中的一种重要解决方案，但其性能受限于难以找到可靠的特征对应关系。本文的主要贡献是一种面向航拍与地面图像的特征匹配算法，其核心思想是通过生成中间视图来缓解大视角变化所带来的透视畸变。首先，仅使用航拍图像，通过增量式运动恢复结构（SfM）引擎重建稀疏模型，以利用其较大的场景覆盖范围。其次，采用三维高斯溅射（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）进行场景渲染，以稀疏点与定向图像作为输入。为实现精确的视图渲染，设计了一种基于航拍图像相机位姿的渲染视点确定算法，用于生成高质量的中间图像，从而在航拍与地面图像之间建立视觉桥梁。第三，借助这些中间图像，在渲染—航拍与渲染—地面图像之间执行可靠的特征匹配，并通过中间视图传递特征对应关系以获得最终匹配。基于真实的航拍与地面数据集的实验验证了所提方法在特征匹配与场景渲染方面的有效性，并与多种主流方法进行了全面比较。实验结果表明，该方法能够显著提高航拍与地面图像的初始及精化匹配数量，获得更加稳定可靠的特征对应关系，并为实现精确的 ISfM 重建和完整的基于 3DGS 的场景渲染提供了充分支撑。
