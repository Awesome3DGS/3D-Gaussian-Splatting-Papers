### 3D Gaussian Splatting for Fine-Detailed Surface Reconstruction in Large-Scale Scene

Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details, supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects. Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results and accurate surface from full-size image optimization.

三维高斯溅射（3D Gaussian Splatting）在表面重建方面的最新发展取得了显著进展。然而，将这些方法扩展到大规模场景仍面临挑战，主要原因在于高计算开销以及户外环境中常见的复杂动态外观。这些问题限制了其在航空测绘和自动驾驶等领域的应用。本文提出了一种新方法，在全尺寸图像监督下重建具备精细细节的大规模表面。首先，我们采用**由粗到细（coarse-to-fine）**的策略，高效重建粗模型；随后，通过自适应场景分割与基于图像分块的子场景精化提升局部细节表现。此外，我们引入**外观解耦模型**以捕捉全局外观变化，并设计**瞬态掩码模型**来减轻移动物体的干扰。最后，我们扩展了多视约束，并针对无纹理区域引入**单视正则化**。我们在公开的无人机采集数据集 **GauU-Scene V2** 上进行了实验。结果表明，据我们所知，该方法在全尺寸图像优化条件下，在视觉保真度与表面精度方面均优于现有的基于 NeRF 和基于高斯的方法。
