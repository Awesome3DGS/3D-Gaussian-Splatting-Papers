### Instant Skinned Gaussian Avatars for Web, Mobile and VR Applications

We present Instant Skinned Gaussian Avatars, a real-time and cross-platform 3D avatar system. Many approaches have been proposed to animate Gaussian Splatting, but they often require camera arrays, long preprocessing times, or high-end GPUs. Some methods attempt to convert Gaussian Splatting into mesh-based representations, achieving lightweight performance but sacrificing visual fidelity. In contrast, our system efficiently animates Gaussian Splatting by leveraging parallel splat-wise processing to dynamically follow the underlying skinned mesh in real time while preserving high visual fidelity. From smartphone-based 3D scanning to on-device preprocessing, the entire process takes just around five minutes, with the avatar generation step itself completed in only about 30 seconds. Our system enables users to instantly transform their real-world appearance into a 3D avatar, making it ideal for seamless integration with social media and metaverse applications.

我们提出了Instant Skinned Gaussian Avatars，一种实时、跨平台的三维头像系统。尽管已有许多方法被提出用于驱动高斯溅射动画，但这些方法往往依赖摄像头阵列、长时间的预处理流程，或高端GPU设备。一些方法尝试将高斯溅射转换为基于网格的表示，以实现轻量级性能，但通常会牺牲视觉保真度。相比之下，我们的系统通过并行的逐点溅射处理策略，使高斯点能够实时动态地跟随底层蒙皮网格，从而在保持高视觉保真的同时实现高效动画驱动。从基于智能手机的三维扫描到设备端预处理，整个流程仅需约五分钟，其中头像生成环节只需约30秒。我们的系统让用户可以瞬间将现实外貌转化为三维头像，非常适合无缝集成到社交媒体和元宇宙应用中。
