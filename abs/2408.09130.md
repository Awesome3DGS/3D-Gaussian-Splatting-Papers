### Gaussian in the Dark: Real-Time View Synthesis From Inconsistent Dark Images Using Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a powerful representation that can synthesize remarkable novel views using consistent multi-view images as input. However, we notice that images captured in dark environments where the scenes are not fully illuminated can exhibit considerable brightness variations and multi-view inconsistency, which poses great challenges to 3D Gaussian Splatting and severely degrades its performance. To tackle this problem, we propose Gaussian-DK. Observing that inconsistencies are mainly caused by camera imaging, we represent a consistent radiance field of the physical world using a set of anisotropic 3D Gaussians, and design a camera response module to compensate for multi-view inconsistencies. We also introduce a step-based gradient scaling strategy to constrain Gaussians near the camera, which turn out to be floaters, from splitting and cloning. Experiments on our proposed benchmark dataset demonstrate that Gaussian-DK produces high-quality renderings without ghosting and floater artifacts and significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we can also synthesize light-up images by controlling exposure levels that clearly show details in shadow areas.

3D高斯投影最近作为一种强大的表示方法出现，能够使用一致的多视角图像作为输入合成出色的新视图。然而，我们注意到，在未完全照明的黑暗环境中拍摄的图像可能会出现显著的亮度变化和多视角不一致性，这对3D高斯投影提出了巨大挑战，并严重降低其性能。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了Gaussian-DK。通过观察，我们发现不一致性主要由相机成像引起，因此我们使用一组各向异性的3D高斯来表示物理世界的一致辐射场，并设计了一个相机响应模块以补偿多视角不一致性。我们还引入了一种基于步进的梯度缩放策略，以限制靠近相机的高斯（这些往往是浮动物）发生分裂和克隆。在我们提出的基准数据集上的实验表明，Gaussian-DK能够生成没有重影和浮动物伪影的高质量渲染效果，并且显著优于现有方法。此外，通过控制曝光水平，我们还可以合成光亮图像，从而清晰地显示阴影区域的细节。
