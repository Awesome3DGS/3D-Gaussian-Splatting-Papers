### SWAGSplatting: Semantic-guided Water-scene Augmented Gaussian Splatting

Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues, however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI, particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy, combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

在水下环境中实现精确的三维重建仍然是一项复杂的挑战，其原因在于光学畸变、浑浊度以及可见度受限等问题。尽管已有基于人工智能的技术尝试解决这些问题，但现有方法尚未充分发挥AI的潜力，尤其是在将语言模型与视觉处理相结合方面。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的框架，利用多模态跨知识构建语义引导的三维高斯溅射，以实现稳健且高保真的深海场景重建。通过在每个高斯基元中嵌入额外的语义特征，并在CLIP提取的语义特征监督下，我们的方法在训练过程中强化了语义与结构感知。专门设计的语义一致性损失确保了与高层次场景理解的对齐。此外，我们提出了一种新的分阶段训练策略，将由粗到细的学习与后期参数优化相结合，以进一步提升稳定性与重建质量。大量实验结果表明，我们的方法在SeaThru-NeRF和Submerged3D数据集的三个指标上均稳定优于现有最先进的方法，平均在PSNR上提升最高可达3.09 dB，使其成为水下探测与海洋感知应用中的有力候选方案。
