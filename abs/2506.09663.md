### Self-Supervised Multi-Part Articulated Objects Modeling via Deformable Gaussian Splatting and Progressive Primitive Segmentation

Articulated objects are ubiquitous in everyday life, and accurate 3D representations of their geometry and motion are critical for numerous applications. However, in the absence of human annotation, existing approaches still struggle to build a unified representation for objects that contain multiple movable parts. We introduce DeGSS, a unified framework that encodes articulated objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, embedding geometry, appearance, and motion in one compact representation. Each interaction state is modeled as a smooth deformation of a shared field, and the resulting deformation trajectories guide a progressive coarse-to-fine part segmentation that identifies distinct rigid components, all in an unsupervised manner. The refined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of every part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their kinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the synthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset that pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and stability.

关节物体在日常生活中无处不在，而其几何与运动的精确三维表示对于众多应用至关重要。然而，在缺乏人工标注的情况下，现有方法仍难以为包含多个可动部件的物体构建统一表示。我们提出 **DeGSS**，一种将关节物体编码为可变形三维高斯场的统一框架，在一个紧凑表示中同时嵌入几何、外观与运动信息。每个交互状态被建模为共享场的平滑形变，而由此产生的形变轨迹则引导自粗到细的渐进式部件分割，在完全无监督的条件下识别出不同的刚性部件。经细化的场能够为每个部件提供空间连续、完全解耦的描述，支持部件级重建及其运动学关系的精确建模。为评估泛化性与逼真度，我们扩展了合成数据集 PartNet-Mobility，并发布 **RS-Art**，一个将真实 RGB 采集与高精度逆向工程的三维模型配对的真实到仿真数据集。大量实验表明，我们的方法在精度与稳定性方面均优于现有方法。
