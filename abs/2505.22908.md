### 3DGS Compression with Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform Coding

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its fast and high-quality rendering, but it has a very large memory footprint incurring high transmission and storage overhead. Recently, some neural compression methods, such as Scaffold-GS, were proposed for 3DGS but they did not adopt the approach of end-to-end optimized analysis-synthesis transforms which has been proven highly effective in neural signal compression. Without an appropriate analysis transform, signal correlations cannot be removed by sparse representation. Without such transforms the only way to remove signal redundancies is through entropy coding driven by a complex and expensive context modeling, which results in slower speed and suboptimal rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To overcome this weakness, we propose Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform Coding (SHTC), the first end-to-end optimized transform coding framework for 3DGS compression. SHTC jointly optimizes the 3DGS, transforms and a lightweight context model. This joint optimization enables the transform to produce representations that approach the best R-D performance possible. The SHTC framework consists of a base layer using KLT for data decorrelation, and a sparsity-coded enhancement layer that compresses the KLT residuals to refine the representation. The enhancement encoder learns a linear transform to project high-dimensional inputs into a low-dimensional space, while the decoder unfolds the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to reconstruct the residuals. All components are designed to be interpretable, allowing the incorporation of signal priors and fewer parameters than black-box transforms. This novel design significantly improves R-D performance with minimal additional parameters and computational overhead.

三维高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）因其高效且高质量的渲染性能而受到广泛关注，但其庞大的内存开销带来了较高的传输与存储负担。近期虽有如 Scaffold-GS 等神经压缩方法被提出用于 3DGS 压缩，但它们并未采用已在神经信号压缩中被广泛验证有效的端到端优化分析-合成变换策略。缺乏合适的分析变换将导致信号间的相关性无法通过稀疏表示去除，此时只能依赖复杂且代价高昂的上下文建模驱动的熵编码来压缩信号冗余，不仅速度较慢，且率失真（Rate-Distortion, R-D）性能不佳。
为克服上述缺陷，我们提出了 Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform Coding（SHTC），这是首个用于 3DGS 压缩的端到端优化变换编码框架。SHTC 联合优化 3DGS 表示、变换模块与轻量级上下文模型，使得编码过程中所学习的表示能够接近最优的 R-D 性能。
SHTC 框架由两个层级组成：基础层使用 KLT（Karhunen–Loève Transform）进行数据去相关，增强层则对 KLT 残差进行稀疏编码以进一步精细表示。增强编码器学习一种线性变换，将高维输入投影到低维空间；解码器则通过展开的迭代收缩-阈值算法（ISTA）重构残差信号。该框架的所有组件均具可解释性，便于融合先验知识，且参数量远少于黑盒型变换方法。
这种新颖的设计在几乎不增加计算开销与模型参数的前提下，显著提升了压缩任务中的率失真性能。
