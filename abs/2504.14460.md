### Metamon-GS: Enhancing Representability with Variance-Guided Densification and Light Encoding

The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced novel view synthesis by utilizing Gaussians to represent scenes. Encoding Gaussian point features with anchor embeddings has significantly enhanced the performance of newer 3DGS variants. While significant advances have been made, it is still challenging to boost rendering performance. Feature embeddings have difficulty accurately representing colors from different perspectives under varying lighting conditions, which leads to a washed-out appearance. Another reason is the lack of a proper densification strategy that prevents Gaussian point growth in thinly initialized areas, resulting in blurriness and needle-shaped artifacts. To address them, we propose Metamon-GS, from innovative viewpoints of variance-guided densification strategy and multi-level hash grid. The densification strategy guided by variance specifically targets Gaussians with high gradient variance in pixels and compensates for the importance of regions with extra Gaussians to improve reconstruction. The latter studies implicit global lighting conditions and accurately interprets color from different perspectives and feature embeddings. Our thorough experiments on publicly available datasets show that Metamon-GS surpasses its baseline model and previous versions, delivering superior quality in rendering novel views.

3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）的引入通过使用高斯表示场景，推动了新视角合成技术的发展。将高斯点特征编码与锚点嵌入相结合，显著提升了新一代 3DGS 方法的表现。尽管已取得显著进展，但提升渲染性能仍然面临挑战。一方面，特征嵌入在不同光照条件下难以准确表达来自不同视角的颜色，导致图像出现泛白现象；另一方面，缺乏有效的致密化策略使得在初始稀疏区域中高斯点无法增长，进而引发模糊和针状伪影等问题。
为解决上述问题，我们提出 Metamon-GS，从两个创新角度切入：基于方差引导的致密化策略与多层次哈希网格结构。其中，基于方差的致密化策略专门针对在像素中具有高梯度方差的高斯点，通过补充高斯点以提升关键区域的重建效果。多层哈希网格结构则用于建模全局隐式光照条件，从而更准确地解析来自不同视角的颜色与特征嵌入。
我们在多个公开数据集上的实验结果表明，Metamon-GS 在渲染新视图的质量上显著优于其基础模型及以往版本。
