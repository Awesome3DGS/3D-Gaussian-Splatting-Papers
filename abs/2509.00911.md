### GS-TG: 3D Gaussian Splatting Accelerator with Tile Grouping for Reducing Redundant Sorting while Preserving Rasterization Efficiency

3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

三维高斯溅射（3D-GS）作为神经辐射场（NeRF）的有前景替代方案，在新视角合成中兼具高速和高图像质量。然而，尽管已有诸多进展，3D-GS仍难以满足实时应用对帧率（FPS）的需求。本文提出了一种基于瓦片分组的加速器GS-TG，通过减少冗余排序操作并保持光栅化效率来提升3D-GS的渲染速度。GS-TG解决了3D-GS渲染中的一个关键权衡问题：增大瓦片尺寸能够有效减少冗余排序，但同时会增加不必要的光栅化计算。为此，在排序阶段，GS-TG将小瓦片分组成大瓦片，使组内瓦片共享排序操作，从而显著减少冗余计算；在光栅化阶段，通过为每个高斯分配一个位掩码来标识其相关的小瓦片，从而高效共享排序结果。因此，GS-TG在排序阶段实现了如同使用大瓦片的效果，而在光栅化阶段则通过位掩码仍能基于原始小瓦片进行处理。GS-TG是一种无损方法，无需重新训练或微调，并可无缝集成到已有的3D-GS优化技术中。实验结果表明，GS-TG在最新的3D-GS加速方法上实现了平均1.54倍的加速。
