### CLoD-GS: Continuous Level-of-Detail via 3D Gaussian Splatting

Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual "popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets.

细节层次（Level of Detail, LoD）是实时计算机图形中一项核心技术，用于在保留视觉保真度的同时控制复杂场景的渲染开销。传统上，LoD采用离散层次（Discrete LoD, DLoD）方式实现，即在不同距离下切换多个不同版本的模型。然而，这一长期使用的范式存在两个主要问题：一是需要为多个模型副本预留大量存储空间，二是在切换过程中会产生明显的“跳变”伪影，影响用户体验。我们认为，新兴的三维高斯泼溅（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）技术具有显式、基元驱动的特性，为构建更理想的连续细节层次（Continuous LoD, CLoD）范式提供了可能。CLoD方法允许在单一统一模型内实现细节的平滑、无缝缩放，从而绕开DLoD的核心问题。为此，我们提出CLoD-GS，一个将连续LoD机制直接融入3DGS表示的框架。我们为每个高斯基元引入一个可学习的、基于距离衰减的参数，依据观察视角与对象的接近程度动态调整其透明度，从而实现不重要基元的逐步、平滑滤除，最终在单一模型中构建出连续的细节层次谱。为了使该模型在所有距离下均具鲁棒性，我们引入虚拟距离缩放机制，并提出一种从粗到细的训练策略，结合渲染点数量正则化。该方法不仅消除了离散方法带来的存储冗余与视觉伪影，还降低了最终模型的基元数量和内存占用。大量实验表明，CLoD-GS可从单一模型实现平滑、可调细节的渲染，在不同性能需求下均能呈现高保真结果。
