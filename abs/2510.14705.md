### Leveraging Learned Image Prior for 3D Gaussian Compression

Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful representational capacity of learned image priors to recover compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

三维高斯溅射（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）的压缩技术近年来在减少存储开销的同时保持高质量渲染方面取得了显著进展。尽管现有方法在压缩率方面表现出色，但由于缺乏可学习先验，其在码率-失真（rate-distortion）平衡上的进一步提升受限。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的3DGS压缩框架，利用图像领域中强大的可学习先验能力来恢复压缩所导致的质量退化。该方法以初步压缩后的高斯点为基础，引入一个恢复网络，在图像空间中建模降质高斯与原始高斯之间的压缩伪影。为了进一步提升码率-失真表现，我们将粗渲染残差信息作为辅助输入引入恢复网络。通过借助恢复图像的监督信号，压缩高斯得以进一步细化，从而获得更紧凑的表示和更高质量的渲染效果。该框架可与现有高斯压缩方法兼容，具有良好的通用性和适配性。大量实验证明，该方法在压缩性能上显著优于当前最先进的3DGS压缩方法，在大幅减少存储需求的同时，提升了最终渲染质量。
