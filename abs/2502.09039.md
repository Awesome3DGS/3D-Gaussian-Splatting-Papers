### Large Images are Gaussians: High-Quality Large Image Representation with Levels of 2D Gaussian Splatting

While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have demonstrated significant success in image representation, they are often hindered by large training memory and slow decoding speed. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a promising solution in 3D reconstruction due to its high-quality novel view synthesis and rapid rendering capabilities, positioning it as a valuable tool for a broad spectrum of applications. In particular, a GS-based representation, 2DGS, has shown potential for image fitting. In our work, we present Large Images are Gaussians (LIG), which delves deeper into the application of 2DGS for image representations, addressing the challenge of fitting large images with 2DGS in the situation of numerous Gaussian points, through two distinct modifications: 1) we adopt a variant of representation and optimization strategy, facilitating the fitting of a large number of Gaussian points; 2) we propose a Level-of-Gaussian approach for reconstructing both coarse low-frequency initialization and fine high-frequency details. Consequently, we successfully represent large images as Gaussian points and achieve high-quality large image representation, demonstrating its efficacy across various types of large images.

尽管隐式神经表示（INRs）在图像表示方面取得了显著成功，但它们通常受到大规模训练内存和较慢解码速度的限制。最近，高斯溅射（GS）由于其高质量的新视角合成和快速渲染能力，成为3D重建领域中的一种有前景的解决方案，定位为广泛应用的有价值工具。特别是，基于GS的表示方法——2DGS，在图像拟合方面显示了潜力。在我们的研究中，我们提出了Large Images are Gaussians (LIG)，进一步探讨了2DGS在图像表示中的应用，解决了在大量高斯点情况下，如何使用2DGS拟合大图像这一挑战，具体通过两项独特的改进：1）我们采用了一种变体的表示和优化策略，便于拟合大量高斯点；2）我们提出了一种高斯层级方法，用于重建粗略的低频初始化和细致的高频细节。因此，我们成功地将大图像表示为高斯点，并实现了高质量的大图像表示，展示了其在多种类型的大图像中的有效性。
