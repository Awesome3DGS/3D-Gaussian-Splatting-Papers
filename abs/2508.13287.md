### InnerGS: Internal Scenes Rendering via Factorized 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with any data modalities.

三维高斯喷溅（3DGS）因其通过显式的各向异性三维高斯集合表示场景，从而实现高效场景渲染，近年来广受关注。然而，大多数现有研究主要集中于外部表面的建模。本文针对内部场景的重建，这对于需要深入理解物体内部结构的应用至关重要。我们通过内部三维高斯分布直接建模连续体积密度，从稀疏切片数据中有效重建平滑且细致的内部结构。我们的方法无需相机位姿，具备即插即用特性，并且天然兼容任何数据模态。
