### 3D Gaussian Splatting Data Compression with Mixture of Priors

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data compression is crucial for enabling efficient storage and transmission in 3D scene modeling. However, its development remains limited due to inadequate entropy models and suboptimal quantization strategies for both lossless and lossy compression scenarios, where existing methods have yet to 1) fully leverage hyperprior information to construct robust conditional entropy models, and 2) apply fine-grained, element-wise quantization strategies for improved compression granularity. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to simultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior information through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior features, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating mechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is utilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling. Meanwhile, for lossy compression, we employ the MoP feature as guidance information in an element-wise quantization procedure, leveraging a prior-guided Coarse-to-Fine Quantization (C2FQ) strategy with a predefined quantization step value. Specifically, we expand the quantization step value into a matrix and adaptively refine it from coarse to fine granularity, guided by the MoP feature, thereby obtaining a quantization step matrix that facilitates element-wise quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DGS data compression framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Mip-NeRF360, BungeeNeRF, DeepBlending, and Tank&Temples.

3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）数据压缩对于实现高效的三维场景建模存储与传输具有重要意义。然而，由于缺乏有效的熵模型以及在无损与有损压缩场景中次优的量化策略，其发展仍较为受限。现有方法尚未解决以下两个关键问题：1）未能充分利用 hyperprior 信息构建稳健的条件熵模型；2）未实现细粒度的逐元素量化策略以提升压缩精度。
为应对这些挑战，本文提出了一种新颖的 Mixture of Priors（MoP） 策略。具体而言，受 Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）范式启发，我们的 MoP 方法通过多个轻量级 MLP 处理 hyperprior 信息，生成多样化的先验特征，并通过 gating 机制将其整合为 MoP 特征。
为增强无损压缩效果，生成的 MoP 特征被用作 hyperprior 以提升条件熵建模能力。而在有损压缩中，我们将 MoP 特征用作逐元素量化过程中的引导信息，引入一种基于先验引导的 由粗到细量化策略（Coarse-to-Fine Quantization, C2FQ），该策略从预定义的量化步长出发，将其扩展为矩阵，并在 MoP 引导下自适应地从粗粒度细化为精粒度，最终得到支持逐元素量化的量化步长矩阵。
大量实验证明，所提出的 3DGS 数据压缩框架在多个基准上实现了当前最优的性能。
