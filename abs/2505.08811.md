### TUGS: Physics-based Compact Representation of Underwater Scenes by Tensorized Gaussian

Underwater 3D scene reconstruction is crucial for undewater robotic perception and navigation. However, the task is significantly challenged by the complex interplay between light propagation, water medium, and object surfaces, with existing methods unable to model their interactions accurately. Additionally, expensive training and rendering costs limit their practical application in underwater robotic systems. Therefore, we propose Tensorized Underwater Gaussian Splatting (TUGS), which can effectively solve the modeling challenges of the complex interactions between object geometries and water media while achieving significant parameter reduction. TUGS employs lightweight tensorized higher-order Gaussians with a physics-based underwater Adaptive Medium Estimation (AME) module, enabling accurate simulation of both light attenuation and backscatter effects in underwater environments. Compared to other NeRF-based and GS-based methods designed for underwater, TUGS is able to render high-quality underwater images with faster rendering speeds and less memory usage. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets have demonstrated that TUGS can efficiently achieve superior reconstruction quality using a limited number of parameters, making it particularly suitable for memory-constrained underwater UAV applications

水下三维场景重建对于水下机器人感知与导航至关重要。然而，由于光传播、水体介质与物体表面之间复杂的相互作用，该任务面临极大挑战，现有方法难以准确建模这些交互过程。此外，高昂的训练与渲染开销也限制了其在水下机器人系统中的实际应用。为此，我们提出了张量化水下高斯投影（Tensorized Underwater Gaussian Splatting, TUGS） 方法，能够有效解决物体几何与水体介质之间复杂交互的建模难题，同时实现显著的参数压缩。TUGS 引入了轻量的张量化高阶高斯表示，并结合基于物理的水下自适应介质估计模块（Adaptive Medium Estimation, AME），可准确模拟水下环境中的光衰减与反向散射效应。与其他基于 NeRF 或高斯投影的水下方法相比，TUGS 可在保持高质量渲染效果的同时，显著提升渲染速度并降低内存占用。我们在多个真实水下数据集上的广泛实验表明，TUGS 在使用极少参数的条件下，仍能实现优越的重建质量，尤其适用于内存受限的水下无人机（UAV）应用场景。
