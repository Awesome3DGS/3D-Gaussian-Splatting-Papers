### Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis in Presence of Distractors

3D Gaussian Splatting has shown impressive novel view synthesis results; nonetheless, it is vulnerable to dynamic objects polluting the input data of an otherwise static scene, so called distractors. Distractors have severe impact on the rendering quality as they get represented as view-dependent effects or result in floating artifacts. Our goal is to identify and ignore such distractors during the 3D Gaussian optimization to obtain a clean reconstruction. To this end, we take a self-supervised approach that looks at the image residuals during the optimization to determine areas that have likely been falsified by a distractor. In addition, we leverage a pretrained segmentation network to provide object awareness, enabling more accurate exclusion of distractors. This way, we obtain segmentation masks of distractors to effectively ignore them in the loss formulation. We demonstrate that our approach is robust to various distractors and strongly improves rendering quality on distractor-polluted scenes, improving PSNR by 1.86dB compared to 3D Gaussian Splatting.

3D 高斯喷涂在新视角合成中展示了令人印象深刻的效果，然而，它容易受到动态物体干扰的影响，这些干扰物会污染原本静态场景的输入数据，被称为干扰物。干扰物会严重影响渲染质量，因为它们会表现为视角依赖的效果或导致浮动的伪影。我们的目标是在 3D 高斯优化过程中识别并忽略这些干扰物，以获得干净的重建效果。为此，我们采用了一种自监督的方法，通过在优化过程中观察图像残差来确定哪些区域可能被干扰物伪造。此外，我们利用预训练的分割网络提供物体感知能力，从而更准确地排除干扰物。通过这种方式，我们获得了干扰物的分割掩码，在损失函数中有效地忽略它们。实验表明，我们的方法对各种干扰物具有鲁棒性，并在干扰物污染的场景中显著提高了渲染质量，与传统 3D 高斯喷涂方法相比，峰值信噪比（PSNR）提高了 1.86dB。
