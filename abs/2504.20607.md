### EfficientHuman: Efficient Training and Reconstruction of Moving Human using Articulated 2D Gaussian

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been recognized as a pioneering technique in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Recent work on reconstructing the 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human pose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it struggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view inconsistency and redundant Gaussians. This inconsistency arises because Gaussian ellipsoids cannot accurately represent the surfaces of dynamic objects, which hinders the rapid reconstruction of the dynamic human body. Meanwhile, the prevalence of redundant Gaussians means that the training time of these works is still not ideal for quickly fitting a dynamic human body. To address these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the dynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while ensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian splats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then transforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve efficient pose transformations. Unlike 3D Gaussians, Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels can quickly conform to the dynamic human body while ensuring view-consistent geometries. Additionally, we introduce a pose calibration module and an LBS optimization module to achieve precise fitting of dynamic human poses, enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-MoCap dataset demonstrate that EfficientHuman achieves rapid 3D dynamic human reconstruction in less than a minute on average, which is 20 seconds faster than the current state-of-the-art method, while also reducing the number of redundant Gaussians.

三维高斯泼溅（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）已被公认为场景重建与新视角合成中的开创性技术。近期在三维人体重建方向的研究尝试利用人体姿态的先验信息，以提升渲染质量并加快训练速度。然而，受限于多视角不一致性与高斯表示冗余，这些方法在动态表面拟合方面仍面临显著挑战。具体而言，Gaussian 椭球体难以精确表示动态物体表面，导致动态人体的快速重建受阻；同时，高斯核的冗余也使得训练时间仍难以满足高效拟合的需求。
为应对上述问题，我们提出了 EfficientHuman，一种基于关节驱动二维高斯（Articulated 2D Gaussian）的高效动态人体重建模型，能够在确保高渲染质量的同时实现快速重建。该方法的关键创新在于：将高斯泼溅编码为标准空间中的 Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels，并通过线性混合蒙皮（Linear Blend Skinning, LBS）将其变换到姿态空间，从而实现高效的姿态变换。与传统三维高斯不同，Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels 可快速贴合动态人体，并保持视角一致的几何结构。
此外，我们还引入了姿态校准模块与 LBS 优化模块，以实现对动态人体姿态的精确拟合，进一步提升模型性能。在 ZJU-MoCap 数据集上的大量实验证明，EfficientHuman 能够平均在一分钟内完成三维动态人体重建，比当前最先进的方法快 20 秒，同时有效减少了冗余高斯数量。
