### Visibility-Aware Densification for 3D Gaussian Splatting in Dynamic Urban Scenes

3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically, achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for both static and dynamic objects.

三维高斯泼溅（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）在合成高保真新视角方面展现出了出色性能。然而，其效果在很大程度上依赖于初始点云的质量。具体而言，为了在场景结构上实现均匀且完整的点覆盖，通常需要重叠的观测视锥，但这一假设在无界、动态的城市环境中往往难以满足。使用部分初始化的点云训练高斯模型常常会导致失真和伪影，因为摄像机光线可能无法与有效表面相交，进而导致与被遮挡或不可见几何相关的高斯基元接收到错误的梯度传播。此外，现有的加密策略通常仅通过克隆和拆分已有的高斯基元来进行点密度增强，无法重建缺失结构。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了VAD-GS，一种面向复杂城市场景几何恢复的3DGS框架。该方法通过基于体素的可见性推理识别不可靠的几何结构，结合多样性感知的视角选择策略提取具有信息量的辅助视角，并利用基于图块匹配的多视图立体重建技术恢复缺失结构。该设计使得即使在初始点缺失区域，也能依据可靠的几何先验生成新的高斯基元。我们在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上进行了大量实验证明，VAD-GS在几何重建质量方面显著优于现有最先进的3DGS方法，且在静态与动态物体上均取得了优异性能。
