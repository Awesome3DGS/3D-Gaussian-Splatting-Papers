### Connecting Consistency Distillation to Score Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation

Although recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have significantly improved generation quality, issues like limited level of detail and low fidelity still persist, which requires further improvement. To understand the essence of those issues, we thoroughly analyze current score distillation methods by connecting theories of consistency distillation to score distillation. Based on the insights acquired through analysis, we propose an optimization framework, Guided Consistency Sampling (GCS), integrated with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to alleviate those issues. Additionally, we have observed the persistent oversaturation in the rendered views of generated 3D assets. From experiments, we find that it is caused by unwanted accumulated brightness in 3DGS during optimization. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Brightness-Equalized Generation (BEG) scheme in 3DGS rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates 3D assets with more details and higher fidelity than state-of-the-art methods.

尽管最近在文本到三维生成的技术进展显著提高了生成质量，但诸如细节水平有限和保真度低等问题仍然存在，这需要进一步改进。为了理解这些问题的本质，我们通过将一致性蒸馏理论与得分蒸馏相结合，对当前的得分蒸馏方法进行了深入分析。基于通过分析获得的洞察，我们提出了一个优化框架——引导一致性采样（GCS），并将其与三维高斯投影（3DGS）整合，以缓解这些问题。此外，我们还观察到生成的三维资产的渲染视图中持续存在过饱和现象。通过实验，我们发现这是由于在优化过程中3DGS中不希望的亮度累积造成的。为了缓解这一问题，我们在3DGS渲染中引入了一个亮度均衡生成（BEG）方案。实验结果表明，我们的方法生成的三维资产比现有最先进方法具有更多细节和更高的保真度。
