### EvaGaussians: Event Stream Assisted Gaussian Splatting from Blurry Images

3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, its training heavily depends on high-quality, sharp images and accurate camera poses. Fulfilling these requirements can be challenging in non-ideal real-world scenarios, where motion-blurred images are commonly encountered in high-speed moving cameras or low-light environments that require long exposure times. To address these challenges, we introduce Event Stream Assisted Gaussian Splatting (EvaGaussians), a novel approach that integrates event streams captured by an event camera to assist in reconstructing high-quality 3D-GS from blurry images. Capitalizing on the high temporal resolution and dynamic range offered by the event camera, we leverage the event streams to explicitly model the formation process of motion-blurred images and guide the deblurring reconstruction of 3D-GS. By jointly optimizing the 3D-GS parameters and recovering camera motion trajectories during the exposure time, our method can robustly facilitate the acquisition of high-fidelity novel views with intricate texture details. We comprehensively evaluated our method and compared it with previous state-of-the-art deblurring rendering methods. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method surpasses existing techniques in restoring fine details from blurry images and producing high-fidelity novel views.

三维高斯溅射（3D-GS）在三维场景重建和新视角合成方面展示了卓越的能力。然而，它的训练严重依赖于高质量、清晰的图像和准确的相机姿态。在非理想的现实世界场景中满足这些要求可能是具有挑战性的，例如在高速移动的摄像机或需要长时间曝光的低光环境中常常遇到的运动模糊图像。为了应对这些挑战，我们引入了事件流辅助高斯溅射（EvaGaussians），这是一种新颖的方法，它整合了由事件摄像机捕获的事件流来协助从模糊图像中重建高质量的3D-GS。利用事件摄像机提供的高时间分辨率和动态范围，我们利用事件流来明确建模运动模糊图像的形成过程，并指导3D-GS的去模糊重建。通过联合优化3D-GS参数和在曝光时间内恢复相机运动轨迹，我们的方法能够稳健地促进具有复杂纹理细节的高保真新视角的获取。我们全面评估了我们的方法，并与之前的最先进的去模糊渲染方法进行了比较。定性和定量的比较均表明，我们的方法在从模糊图像恢复细节和产生高保真新视角方面超越了现有技术。
