### COB-GS: Clear Object Boundaries in 3DGS Segmentation Based on Boundary-Adaptive Gaussian Splitting

Accurate object segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D segmentation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles with accurately delineating object boundaries, as Gaussian primitives often span across object edges due to their inherent volume and the lack of semantic guidance during training. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce Clear Object Boundaries for 3DGS Segmentation (COB-GS), which aims to improve segmentation accuracy by clearly delineating blurry boundaries of interwoven Gaussian primitives within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that remove ambiguous Gaussians and sacrifice visual quality, COB-GS, as a 3DGS refinement method, jointly optimizes semantic and visual information, allowing the two different levels to cooperate with each other effectively. Specifically, for the semantic guidance, we introduce a boundary-adaptive Gaussian splitting technique that leverages semantic gradient statistics to identify and split ambiguous Gaussians, aligning them closely with object boundaries. For the visual optimization, we rectify the degraded suboptimal texture of the 3DGS scene, particularly along the refined boundary structures. Experimental results show that COB-GS substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained model, yielding clear boundaries while preserving high visual quality.

在三维视觉领域，实现高质量场景理解的关键在于精确的目标分割。然而，基于三维高斯溅射（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）的方法在准确描绘物体边界方面存在困难，这是因为高斯基元具有一定体积，容易跨越物体边界扩散，并且训练过程中缺乏语义引导。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了 COB-GS（Clear Object Boundaries for 3DGS Segmentation），旨在通过清晰地划分场景中交织在一起的模糊高斯基元边界，提升三维分割的准确性。
与现有方法依赖剔除模糊高斯、从而牺牲视觉质量不同，COB-GS 作为一种 3DGS 精化方法，同时优化语义信息与视觉表现，使两个层次能够有效协同。具体而言，在语义引导方面，我们引入了一种边界自适应高斯分裂技术，利用语义梯度统计信息识别并分裂模糊的高斯基元，使其更加贴合物体边界。在视觉优化方面，我们对精化边界结构上的次优纹理进行修正，从而提升整体渲染质量。
实验结果表明，COB-GS 显著提高了分割精度，并增强了对预训练模型生成的不准确掩膜的鲁棒性，在保留高视觉质量的同时，实现了边界的清晰呈现。
