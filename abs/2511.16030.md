### CuriGS: Curriculum-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Sparse View Synthesis

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

三维高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）作为一种高效且高保真的实时场景重建与渲染表示方式，近年来受到广泛关注。然而，将 3DGS 扩展到稀疏视图场景仍面临重大挑战，主要原因在于监督信号稀缺以及视角覆盖受限所导致的过拟合问题。为解决这一问题，本文提出 CuriGS，一种基于课程学习的 3DGS 稀疏视图重建框架。CuriGS 的核心策略是引入“学生视图”（student views）：围绕真实视角（教师）进行扰动采样所生成的伪视角图像。针对每个教师视角，我们生成多个具有不同扰动强度的学生视图组。训练过程中遵循课程学习策略，逐步解锁更高扰动等级，并从当前活跃等级中随机采样候选学生视图参与训练。每个采样到的学生视图会通过深度相关性和协同正则进行约束，并通过结合 SSIM、LPIPS 与图像质量指标的多信号评分体系进行评估。在训练过程中，我们会周期性保留表现最优的学生视图，并将达到预设质量阈值的学生样本加入训练集，从而稳定扩充原始稀疏监督视角。大量实验结果表明，CuriGS 在多个合成与真实稀疏视图场景中，在渲染保真度与几何一致性方面均优于当前主流方法。
