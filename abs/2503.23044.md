### CityGS-X: A Scalable Architecture for Efficient and Geometrically Accurate Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction

Despite its significant achievements in large-scale scene reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting still faces substantial challenges, including slow processing, high computational costs, and limited geometric accuracy. These core issues arise from its inherently unstructured design and the absence of efficient parallelization. To overcome these challenges simultaneously, we introduce CityGS-X, a scalable architecture built on a novel parallelized hybrid hierarchical 3D representation (PH^2-3D). As an early attempt, CityGS-X abandons the cumbersome merge-and-partition process and instead adopts a newly-designed batch-level multi-task rendering process. This architecture enables efficient multi-GPU rendering through dynamic Level-of-Detail voxel allocations, significantly improving scalability and performance. Through extensive experiments, CityGS-X consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of faster training times, larger rendering capacities, and more accurate geometric details in large-scale scenes. Notably, CityGS-X can train and render a scene with 5,000+ images in just 5 hours using only 4 * 4090 GPUs, a task that would make other alternative methods encounter Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues and fail completely. This implies that CityGS-X is far beyond the capacity of other existing methods.

尽管三维高斯泼洒（3D Gaussian Splatting）在大规模场景重建中取得了显著成果，但仍面临诸多挑战，包括处理速度慢、计算开销大和几何精度受限等。这些核心问题源于其本身无结构的设计以及缺乏高效并行化机制。
为同时克服上述挑战，本文提出了CityGS-X，一种基于新型并行混合分层三维表示（Parallelized Hybrid Hierarchical 3D Representation, PH²-3D）的可扩展架构。作为首次尝试，CityGS-X摒弃了繁琐的“合并与划分”过程，转而采用全新设计的批量级多任务渲染流程（batch-level multi-task rendering process）。该架构通过动态细节层次（Level-of-Detail）体素分配实现高效的多GPU渲染，显著提升了系统的可扩展性与性能。
通过大量实验验证，CityGS-X在训练速度、更大规模渲染能力以及大场景几何细节精度方面，均持续优于现有方法。值得注意的是，CityGS-X仅使用4块4090 GPU，在5小时内即可完成包含5000张以上图像的场景训练与渲染任务，而其他方法在同等条件下通常会因显存溢出（Out-Of-Memory, OOM）而失败。这表明，CityGS-X在容量与性能上远超现有所有方法。
