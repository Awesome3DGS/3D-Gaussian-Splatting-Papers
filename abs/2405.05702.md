### NGM-SLAM: Gaussian Splatting SLAM with Radiance Field Submap

Gaussian Splatting has garnered widespread attention due to its exceptional performance. Consequently, SLAM systems based on Gaussian Splatting have emerged, leveraging its capabilities for rapid real-time rendering and high-fidelity mapping. However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems usually struggle with large scene representation and lack effective loop closure adjustments and scene generalization capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce NGM-SLAM, the first GS-SLAM system that utilizes neural radiance field submaps for progressive scene expression, effectively integrating the strengths of neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. We have developed neural implicit submaps as supervision and achieve high-quality scene expression and online loop closure adjustments through Gaussian rendering of fused submaps. Our results on multiple real-world scenes and large-scale scene datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate gap filling and high-quality scene expression, supporting both monocular, stereo, and RGB-D inputs, and achieving state-of-the-art scene reconstruction and tracking performance.

高斯喷溅由于其卓越的性能而受到广泛关注。因此，基于高斯喷溅的 SLAM（同步定位与地图构建）系统已经出现，利用其快速实时渲染和高保真度映射的能力。然而，当前的高斯喷溅 SLAM 系统通常在大场景表示上存在困难，且缺乏有效的闭环调整和场景泛化能力。为解决这些问题，我们引入了 NGM-SLAM，这是第一个利用神经辐射场子图进行逐步场景表达的 GS-SLAM 系统，有效整合了神经辐射场和三维高斯喷溅的优势。我们开发了作为监督的神经隐式子图，并通过融合子图的高斯渲染实现高质量的场景表达和在线闭环调整。我们在多个真实世界场景和大规模场景数据集上的结果表明，我们的方法能够实现精确的缺口填补和高质量的场景表达，支持单目、立体和 RGB-D 输入，并实现了最先进的场景重建和跟踪性能。
