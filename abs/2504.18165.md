### PerfCam: Digital Twinning for Production Lines Using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Vision Models

We introduce PerfCam, an open source Proof-of-Concept (PoC) digital twinning framework that combines camera and sensory data with 3D Gaussian Splatting and computer vision models for digital twinning, object tracking, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) extraction in industrial production lines. By utilizing 3D reconstruction and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), PerfCam offers a semi-automated approach to object tracking and spatial mapping, enabling digital twins that capture real-time KPIs such as availability, performance, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), and rate of conveyor belts in the production line. We validate the effectiveness of PerfCam through a practical deployment within realistic test production lines in the pharmaceutical industry and contribute an openly published dataset to support further research and development in the field. The results demonstrate PerfCam's ability to deliver actionable insights through its precise digital twin capabilities, underscoring its value as an effective tool for developing usable digital twins in smart manufacturing environments and extracting operational analytics.

我们提出 PerfCam，一个开源的概念验证（Proof-of-Concept, PoC）型数字孪生框架，结合摄像头与传感器数据、三维高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting）以及计算机视觉模型，用于工业产线中的数字孪生、目标跟踪与关键绩效指标（KPI）提取。PerfCam 借助三维重建与卷积神经网络（CNN），提供了一种半自动化的目标跟踪与空间映射方案，从而实现可实时捕捉 KPI（如可用性、性能、设备综合效率 OEE 及传送带速率等）的数字孪生系统。
我们在制药行业的真实测试产线中部署 PerfCam，并验证其有效性，同时公开发布了相关数据集，支持该领域的进一步研究与开发。实验结果表明，PerfCam 能通过精准的数字孪生能力提供可行的业务洞察，体现出其作为智能制造环境中高效数字孪生构建与运营分析工具的价值。
