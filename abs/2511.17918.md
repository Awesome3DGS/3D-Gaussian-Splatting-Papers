### Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization for Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting Generalization

Despite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excelling in most configurations, it lacks generalization across novel viewpoints in a few-shot scenario because it overfits to the sparse observations. We revisit 3DGS optimization from a machine learning perspective, framing novel view synthesis as a generalization problem to unseen viewpoints-an underexplored direction. We propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which reformulates the 3DGS training objective, thereby guiding 3DGS to converge toward a better generalization solution. Although Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) similarly reduces the sharpness of the loss landscape to improve generalization of classification models, directly employing it to 3DGS is suboptimal due to the discrepancy between the tasks. Specifically, it hinders reconstructing high-frequency details due to excessive regularization, while reducing its strength leads to under-penalizing sharpness. To address this, we reflect the local frequency of images to set the regularization weight and the neighborhood radius when estimating the local sharpness. It prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints and reconstructs fine details that SAM tends to oversmooth. Across datasets with various configurations, our method consistently improves a wide range of baselines.

尽管三维高斯溅射（3DGS）在大多数配置中表现出色，但在小样本场景下对新视角的泛化能力不足，因为它容易对稀疏观测结果过拟合。我们从机器学习的视角重新审视3DGS的优化过程，将新视角合成问题建模为一个对未见视角的泛化问题——这是一个尚未被充分探索的方向。为此，我们提出了频率自适应锐度正则化（FASR），重新构建3DGS的训练目标，引导其收敛至更具泛化能力的解。虽然锐度感知最小化（SAM）也通过降低损失函数的锐度提升分类模型的泛化能力，但将其直接应用于3DGS是不理想的，因为两者任务差异显著。具体而言，SAM会由于正则过强而抑制高频细节重建，而降低正则强度又会导致对锐度惩罚不足。为解决这一问题，我们通过图像的局部频率信息动态设定正则权重和局部锐度估计的邻域半径。这种方法有效避免了新视角下的浮动伪影，同时保留了SAM常常过度平滑的细节。在多个数据集与不同配置下，FASR均显著提升了各类基线方法的表现。
