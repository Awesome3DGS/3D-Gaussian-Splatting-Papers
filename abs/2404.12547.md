### Does Gaussian Splatting need SFM Initialization?

3D Gaussian Splatting has recently been embraced as a versatile and effective method for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, owing to its high-quality results and compatibility with hardware rasterization. Despite its advantages, Gaussian Splatting's reliance on high-quality point cloud initialization by Structure-from-Motion (SFM) algorithms is a significant limitation to be overcome. To this end, we investigate various initialization strategies for Gaussian Splatting and delve into how volumetric reconstructions from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can be utilized to bypass the dependency on SFM data. Our findings demonstrate that random initialization can perform much better if carefully designed and that by employing a combination of improved initialization strategies and structure distillation from low-cost NeRF models, it is possible to achieve equivalent results, or at times even superior, to those obtained from SFM initialization.

3D 高斯喷溅近来被广泛认为是场景重建和新视角合成的一种多功能且有效的方法，这归功于其高质量的结果和与硬件光栅化的兼容性。尽管有其优点，高斯喷溅依赖于由结构运动（SFM）算法进行的高质量点云初始化是一个需要克服的重大限制。为此，我们研究了各种高斯喷溅的初始化策略，并深入探讨了如何利用来自神经辐射场（NeRF）的体积重建来绕过对SFM数据的依赖。我们的发现表明，如果设计得当，随机初始化的性能可以大大提升，而且通过采用改进的初始化策略和从低成本NeRF模型中提取结构，有可能达到与SFM初始化相当，甚至有时超过SFM初始化的结果。
