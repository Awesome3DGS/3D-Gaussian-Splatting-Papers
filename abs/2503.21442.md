### RainyGS: Efficient Rain Synthesis with Physically-Based Gaussian Splatting

We consider the problem of adding dynamic rain effects to in-the-wild scenes in a physically-correct manner. Recent advances in scene modeling have made significant progress, with NeRF and 3DGS techniques emerging as powerful tools for reconstructing complex scenes. However, while effective for novel view synthesis, these methods typically struggle with challenging scene editing tasks, such as physics-based rain simulation. In contrast, traditional physics-based simulations can generate realistic rain effects, such as raindrops and splashes, but they often rely on skilled artists to carefully set up high-fidelity scenes. This process lacks flexibility and scalability, limiting its applicability to broader, open-world environments. In this work, we introduce RainyGS, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both physics-based modeling and 3DGS to generate photorealistic, dynamic rain effects in open-world scenes with physical accuracy. At the core of our method is the integration of physically-based raindrop and shallow water simulation techniques within the fast 3DGS rendering framework, enabling realistic and efficient simulations of raindrop behavior, splashes, and reflections. Our method supports synthesizing rain effects at over 30 fps, offering users flexible control over rain intensity -- from light drizzles to heavy downpours. We demonstrate that RainyGS performs effectively for both real-world outdoor scenes and large-scale driving scenarios, delivering more photorealistic and physically-accurate rain effects compared to state-of-the-art methods.

我们关注的问题是如何以物理正确的方式为自然场景添加动态雨效。近年来，场景建模技术取得了显著进展，NeRF 和 3DGS 等方法已成为重建复杂场景的有力工具。然而，尽管这些方法在新视角合成方面表现出色，但通常难以胜任如基于物理的雨景模拟等复杂场景编辑任务。相比之下，传统的基于物理的模拟可以生成逼真的雨滴与水花效果，但往往依赖经验丰富的艺术家精心搭建高保真场景。这种流程缺乏灵活性与可扩展性，难以适用于更广泛的开放世界环境。
在本工作中，我们提出了一种新方法 RainyGS，融合了基于物理建模与 3DGS 的优势，能够在开放世界场景中以物理精度生成照片级真实的动态雨效。我们方法的核心是将物理驱动的雨滴与浅水模拟技术整合进高效的 3DGS 渲染框架中，从而实现雨滴运动、水花飞溅与镜面反射的真实高效模拟。该方法支持以超过 30 帧每秒的速度合成雨景，并允许用户灵活控制降雨强度——从细雨到暴雨皆可调节。
我们展示了 RainyGS 在真实户外场景和大规模驾驶场景中均表现出色，生成的雨效在真实感与物理准确性方面均优于当前最先进方法。
