### Isotropic Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering

The 3D Gaussian splatting method has drawn a lot of attention, thanks to its high performance in training and high quality of the rendered image. However, it uses anisotropic Gaussian kernels to represent the scene. Although such anisotropic kernels have advantages in representing the geometry, they lead to difficulties in terms of computation, such as splitting or merging two kernels. In this paper, we propose to use isotropic Gaussian kernels to avoid such difficulties in the computation, leading to a higher performance method. The experiments confirm that the proposed method is about {\bf 100X} faster without losing the geometry representation accuracy. The proposed method can be applied in a large range applications where the radiance field is needed, such as 3D reconstruction, view synthesis, and dynamic object modeling.

3D高斯喷溅方法由于其在训练中的高性能和渲染图像的高质量而受到了广泛关注。然而，它使用各向异性高斯核来表示场景。尽管这样的各向异性核在表示几何形状方面有其优势，但它们在计算方面导致了困难，例如分裂或合并两个核。在本文中，我们提出使用各向同性高斯核以避免计算中的这些困难，从而导致一种性能更高的方法。实验确认，所提出的方法在不失去几何表示精度的情况下，速度约快了 **100倍**。所提出的方法可以应用于大范围需要辐射场的应用中，如3D重建、视图合成和动态物体建模。
