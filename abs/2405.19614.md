### TAMBRIDGE: Bridging Frame-Centered Tracking and 3D Gaussian Splatting for Enhanced SLAM

The limited robustness of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to motion blur and camera noise, along with its poor real-time performance, restricts its application in robotic SLAM tasks. Upon analysis, the primary causes of these issues are the density of views with motion blur and the cumulative errors in dense pose estimation from calculating losses based on noisy original images and rendering results, which increase the difficulty of 3DGS rendering convergence. Thus, a cutting-edge 3DGS-based SLAM system is introduced, leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of 3DGS to achieve real-time performance while remaining robust against sensor noise, motion blur, and the challenges posed by long-session SLAM. Central to this approach is the Fusion Bridge module, which seamlessly integrates tracking-centered ORB Visual Odometry with mapping-centered online 3DGS. Precise pose initialization is enabled by this module through joint optimization of re-projection and rendering loss, as well as strategic view selection, enhancing rendering convergence in large-scale scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and localization accuracy, positioning this system as a promising solution for real-world robotics applications that require stable, near-real-time performance.

三维高斯溅射（3DGS）对运动模糊和相机噪声的有限鲁棒性，以及其较差的实时性能，限制了其在机器人SLAM任务中的应用。通过分析，这些问题的主要原因是运动模糊视图的密度和从计算基于噪声原始图像和渲染结果的损失的密集姿态估计中累积的错误，这增加了3DGS渲染收敛的难度。因此，引入了一种尖端的基于3DGS的SLAM系统，利用3DGS的效率和灵活性实现实时性能，同时对抗传感器噪声、运动模糊和长时间会话SLAM所带来的挑战。这种方法的核心是Fusion Bridge模块，该模块无缝集成了以跟踪为中心的ORB视觉里程计和以映射为中心的在线3DGS。通过联合优化重投影和渲染损失，以及战略性视图选择，该模块实现了精确的姿态初始化，增强了大规模场景中的渲染收敛。广泛的实验表明，该系统具有最先进的渲染质量和定位精度，是现实世界机器人应用中要求稳定、接近实时性能的有希望的解决方案。
