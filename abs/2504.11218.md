### 3DAffordSplat: Efficient Affordance Reasoning with 3D Gaussians

3D affordance reasoning is essential in associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, facilitating precise, task-oriented manipulations in embodied AI. However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.

三维可供性推理（3D affordance reasoning）在将人类指令与三维物体的功能区域关联方面至关重要，可为具身智能中的任务导向型操控提供精确支持。然而，现有方法主要依赖稀疏的三维点云输入，因其对坐标变化高度敏感且数据本身稀疏，导致泛化能力和鲁棒性较弱。
相比之下，3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）通过将场景表示为稠密的连续分布，能够以极低的计算开销实现高保真、实时渲染。这使得 3DGS 在捕捉细粒度可供性信息与提升识别精度方面具备天然优势。然而，由于缺乏大规模、专用于 3DGS 的可供性数据集，这一潜力尚未被充分挖掘。
为解决这一问题，我们提出 3DAffordSplat，首个专为基于 3DGS 的可供性推理任务设计的大规模多模态数据集。该数据集包含 23,677 个高斯实例、8,354 个点云实例与 6,631 条人工标注的可供性标签，覆盖 21 个物体类别和 18 种可供性类型。
基于该数据集，我们进一步提出了 AffordSplatNet，一款专门面向 3DGS 表示的可供性推理模型。AffordSplatNet 设计了创新性的跨模态结构对齐模块，利用结构一致性先验对点云与高斯表示进行对齐，从而提升可供性识别的准确率。
大量实验表明，3DAffordSplat 数据集显著推动了 3DGS 领域内的可供性学习研究，而 AffordSplatNet 则在已见与未见场景中均优于现有方法，展现出卓越的泛化能力。
