### SC-OmniGS: Self-Calibrating Omnidirectional Gaussian Splatting

360-degree cameras streamline data collection for radiance field 3D reconstruction by capturing comprehensive scene data. However, traditional radiance field methods do not address the specific challenges inherent to 360-degree images. We present SC-OmniGS, a novel self-calibrating omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast and accurate omnidirectional radiance field reconstruction using 360-degree images. Rather than converting 360-degree images to cube maps and performing perspective image calibration, we treat 360-degree images as a whole sphere and derive a mathematical framework that enables direct omnidirectional camera pose calibration accompanied by 3D Gaussians optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiable omnidirectional camera model in order to rectify the distortion of real-world data for performance enhancement. Overall, the omnidirectional camera intrinsic model, extrinsic poses, and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized by minimizing weighted spherical photometric loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed SC-OmniGS is able to recover a high-quality radiance field from noisy camera poses or even no pose prior in challenging scenarios characterized by wide baselines and non-object-centric configurations. The noticeable performance gain in the real-world dataset captured by consumer-grade omnidirectional cameras verifies the effectiveness of our general omnidirectional camera model in reducing the distortion of 360-degree images.

360度相机通过捕捉全面的场景数据，简化了辐射场3D重建的数据收集过程。然而，传统的辐射场方法并未解决360度图像固有的特定挑战。我们提出了SC-OmniGS，一种新颖的自校准全向高斯溅射系统，旨在利用360度图像实现快速且精确的全向辐射场重建。不同于将360度图像转换为立方体图并进行透视图像校准，我们将360度图像视为一个完整的球体，并推导出一个数学框架，使得能够直接进行全向相机位姿校准，同时优化3D高斯。此外，我们引入了一个可微分的全向相机模型，以纠正真实数据的畸变，从而提高性能。总体而言，全向相机内参模型、外参位姿和3D高斯通过最小化加权球面光度损失共同优化。大量实验表明，我们提出的SC-OmniGS能够在具有宽基线和非物体中心配置的挑战性场景中，从噪声相机位姿甚至无位姿先验的情况下恢复高质量的辐射场。由消费级全向相机捕获的真实世界数据集上，性能的显著提升验证了我们通用全向相机模型在减少360度图像畸变方面的有效性。
