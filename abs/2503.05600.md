### D2GV: Deformable 2D Gaussian Splatting for Video Representation in 400FPS

Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful approach for video representation, offering versatility across tasks such as compression and inpainting. However, their implicit formulation limits both interpretability and efficacy, undermining their practicality as a comprehensive solution. We propose a novel video representation based on deformable 2D Gaussian splatting, dubbed D2GV, which aims to achieve three key objectives: 1) improved efficiency while delivering superior quality; 2) enhanced scalability and interpretability; and 3) increased friendliness for downstream tasks. Specifically, we initially divide the video sequence into fixed-length Groups of Pictures (GoP) to allow parallel training and linear scalability with video length. For each GoP, D2GV represents video frames by applying differentiable rasterization to 2D Gaussians, which are deformed from a canonical space into their corresponding timestamps. Notably, leveraging efficient CUDA-based rasterization, D2GV converges fast and decodes at speeds exceeding 400 FPS, while delivering quality that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art INRs. Moreover, we incorporate a learnable pruning and quantization strategy to streamline D2GV into a more compact representation. We demonstrate D2GV's versatility in tasks including video interpolation, inpainting and denoising, underscoring its potential as a promising solution for video representation.

隐式神经表示 (Implicit Neural Representations, INRs) 已成为视频表示的一种强大方法，在压缩、修复等任务上展现出极大的灵活性。然而，其隐式公式限制了可解释性和有效性，削弱了其作为通用解决方案的实用性。为此，我们提出了一种基于可变形二维高斯散点 (Deformable 2D Gaussian Splatting) 的新型视频表示方法，称为 D2GV，旨在实现以下三个核心目标：1) 在提升质量的同时提高效率；2) 增强可扩展性和可解释性；3) 提高对下游任务的友好性。
具体而言，我们首先将视频序列划分为固定长度的图像组 (GoP, Groups of Pictures)，以支持并行训练，并确保随视频长度线性扩展。对于每个 GoP，D2GV 通过可微光栅化 (Differentiable Rasterization) 处理 2D 高斯基元，并根据时间戳从一个标准空间进行变形表示。值得注意的是，D2GV 依托高效的 CUDA 加速光栅化，实现了快速收敛，并以超过 400 FPS 的解码速度提供与最先进 INR 方法相匹配甚至更优的质量。此外，我们引入了可学习的剪枝与量化策略，以优化 D2GV，使其更加紧凑高效。
我们在视频插值、修复和去噪等任务上验证了 D2GV 的多功能性，进一步表明其作为新一代视频表示方案的潜力。
