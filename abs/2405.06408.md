### I3DGS: Improve 3D Gaussian Splatting from Multiple Dimensions

3D Gaussian Splatting is a novel method for 3D view synthesis, which can gain an implicit neural learning rendering result than the traditional neural rendering technology but keep the more high-definition fast rendering speed. But it is still difficult to achieve a fast enough efficiency on 3D Gaussian Splatting for the practical applications. To Address this issue, we propose the I3DS, a synthetic model performance improvement evaluation solution and experiments test. From multiple and important levels or dimensions of the original 3D Gaussian Splatting, we made more than two thousand various kinds of experiments to test how the selected different items and components can make an impact on the training efficiency of the 3D Gaussian Splatting model. In this paper, we will share abundant and meaningful experiences and methods about how to improve the training, performance and the impacts caused by different items of the model. A special but normal Integer compression in base 95 and a floating-point compression in base 94 with ASCII encoding and decoding mechanism is presented. Many real and effective experiments and test results or phenomena will be recorded. After a series of reasonable fine-tuning, I3DS can gain excellent performance improvements than the previous one.

3D 高斯喷涂是一种用于3D视图合成的新方法，相较于传统的神经渲染技术，它能实现更隐式的神经学习渲染结果，同时保持更高清晰度的快速渲染速度。然而，在实际应用中实现足够快的效率仍然具有挑战性。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了 I3DS，这是一种合成模型性能改进评估解决方案，包括实验测试。通过对原始3D高斯喷涂的多个重要层面或维度进行分析，我们进行了超过两千种不同类型的实验，以测试选定的不同项目和组件如何影响3D高斯喷涂模型的训练效率。在本文中，我们将分享关于如何改进训练、性能以及模型不同项目带来的影响的丰富而有意义的经验和方法。本文还介绍了一种特殊但常见的基于95的整数压缩和基于94的浮点压缩，以及ASCII编码和解码机制。许多实际有效的实验和测试结果或现象将被记录。经过一系列合理的微调，I3DS能比之前取得显著的性能改进。
