### Mirror-3DGS: Incorporating Mirror Reflections into 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in the realm of 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS, much like its predecessor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), struggles to accurately model physical reflections, particularly in mirrors that are ubiquitous in real-world scenes. This oversight mistakenly perceives reflections as separate entities that physically exist, resulting in inaccurate reconstructions and inconsistent reflective properties across varied viewpoints. To address this pivotal challenge, we introduce Mirror-3DGS, an innovative rendering framework devised to master the intricacies of mirror geometries and reflections, paving the way for the generation of realistically depicted mirror reflections. By ingeniously incorporating mirror attributes into the 3DGS and leveraging the principle of plane mirror imaging, Mirror-3DGS crafts a mirrored viewpoint to observe from behind the mirror, enriching the realism of scene renderings. Extensive assessments, spanning both synthetic and real-world scenes, showcase our method's ability to render novel views with enhanced fidelity in real-time, surpassing the state-of-the-art Mirror-NeRF specifically within the challenging mirror regions. Our code will be made publicly available for reproducible research.

三维高斯喷溅（3DGS）在三维场景重建和新颖视角合成领域标志着一个重大突破。然而，像其前身神经辐射场（NeRF）一样，3DGS在准确模拟物理反射方面存在困难，特别是在现实世界场景中无处不在的镜子反射。这种疏忽错误地将反射视为物理存在的独立实体，导致重建不准确和反射属性在不同视点间的不一致。为了解决这个关键挑战，我们引入了Mirror-3DGS，一个创新的渲染框架，旨在掌握镜面几何形态和反射的复杂性，为真实地描绘镜面反射铺平了道路。通过巧妙地将镜面属性融入3DGS，并利用平面镜成像原理，Mirror-3DGS创造了一个镜面视点，从镜子后面进行观察，增强了场景渲染的真实感。广泛的评估，涵盖合成和现实世界场景，展示了我们的方法在实时渲染新颖视角时，在具有挑战性的镜面区域内，提高了保真度，超越了最先进的Mirror-NeRF。
