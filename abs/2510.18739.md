### Moving Light Adaptive Colonoscopy Reconstruction via Illumination-Attenuation-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle, which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner. Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while significantly reducing Depth MSE.

三维高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting，简称3DGS）已成为结肠镜检查中实时视图合成的关键技术，支持如虚拟结肠镜和病灶追踪等重要应用。然而，原始的3DGS方法假设照明为静态，且观测到的外观仅依赖于视角，这与结肠镜场景中由动态光源/摄像头引起的光照变化不兼容。这种不匹配迫使大多数3DGS方法在摄像头与组织之间引入违反结构的雾状高斯斑点，以补偿光照衰减，最终导致三维重建质量下降。现有工作通常仅考虑由光源距离引起的光照衰减，忽略了光源和摄像头的物理特性。本文提出ColIAGS——一种面向结肠镜场景的改进型3DGS框架。为模拟在变化光照条件下的真实外观，我们引入了改进的外观建模机制，利用两类光照衰减因子，使高斯能够适应光度变化，同时保持几何精度。为满足外观建模对几何逼近的要求，我们提出改进的几何建模方法，引入高维视角嵌入以提升高斯几何属性的预测能力。此外，我们还利用另一组余弦嵌入作为输入，以隐式方式生成光照衰减解。大量标准基准测试的实验结果表明，所提出的ColIAGS不仅能够实现新视角合成，还具备高精度的几何重建能力。在渲染保真度和深度MSE显著下降方面，均显著优于现有最先进的方法。
