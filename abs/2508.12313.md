### Improving Densification in 3D Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Rendering

Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved impressive performance in real-time rendering, its densification strategy often results in suboptimal reconstruction quality. In this work, we present a comprehensive improvement to the densification pipeline of 3DGS from three perspectives: when to densify, how to densify, and how to mitigate overfitting. Specifically, we propose an Edge-Aware Score to effectively select candidate Gaussians for splitting. We further introduce a Long-Axis Split strategy that reduces geometric distortions introduced by clone and split operations. To address overfitting, we design a set of techniques, including Recovery-Aware Pruning, Multi-step Update, and Growth Control. Our method enhances rendering fidelity without introducing additional training or inference overhead, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer Gaussians.

尽管三维高斯泼溅（3DGS）在实时渲染中已取得令人瞩目的表现，其加密策略往往导致次优的重建质量。在本工作中，我们从三个方面对 3DGS 的加密流程进行了全面改进：何时加密、如何加密，以及如何缓解过拟合。具体而言，我们提出了一种 **边缘感知评分（Edge-Aware Score）**，用于高效选择待分裂的候选高斯。我们进一步引入 **长轴分裂（Long-Axis Split）** 策略，以减少克隆与分裂操作带来的几何畸变。为应对过拟合，我们设计了一系列技术，包括 **恢复感知剪枝（Recovery-Aware Pruning）**、**多步更新（Multi-step Update）** 与 **增长控制（Growth Control）**。该方法在不增加额外训练或推理开销的情况下提升了渲染保真度，并以更少的高斯实现了当前最优性能。
