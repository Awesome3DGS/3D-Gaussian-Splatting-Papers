### Enhancing Close-up Novel View Synthesis via Pseudo-labeling

Recent methods, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in novel view synthesis. However, despite their success in producing high-quality images for viewpoints similar to those seen during training, they struggle when generating detailed images from viewpoints that significantly deviate from the training set, particularly in close-up views. The primary challenge stems from the lack of specific training data for close-up views, leading to the inability of current methods to render these views accurately. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pseudo-label-based learning strategy. This approach leverages pseudo-labels derived from existing training data to provide targeted supervision across a wide range of close-up viewpoints. Recognizing the absence of benchmarks for this specific challenge, we also present a new dataset designed to assess the effectiveness of both current and future methods in this area. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

近年来，神经辐射场 (NeRF) 和 3D 高斯散点 (3DGS) 等方法在新视角合成方面展现出了卓越的能力。然而，尽管它们在生成与训练视角相似的高质量图像方面取得了成功，但在生成与训练集存在较大偏差的视角，特别是近景视角时，仍然存在明显的挑战。这一问题的核心原因在于缺乏针对近景视角的特定训练数据，导致现有方法难以精确渲染这些视角的细节。
为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种基于伪标签的学习策略。该方法利用从已有训练数据中生成的伪标签，为广泛的近景视角提供有针对性的监督，从而提升渲染质量。此外，考虑到当前缺乏专门针对该挑战的基准测试，我们构建了一个新数据集，用于评估现有方法和未来方法在这一问题上的表现。
大量实验结果表明，我们的方法能够有效提升近景视角的渲染质量，并在该任务上取得了显著的性能提升。
