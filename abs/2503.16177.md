### OccluGaussian: Occlusion-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Large Scene Reconstruction and Rendering

In large-scale scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting, it is common to partition the scene into multiple smaller regions and reconstruct them individually. However, existing division methods are occlusion-agnostic, meaning that each region may contain areas with severe occlusions. As a result, the cameras within those regions are less correlated, leading to a low average contribution to the overall reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-aware scene division strategy that clusters training cameras based on their positions and co-visibilities to acquire multiple regions. Cameras in such regions exhibit stronger correlations and a higher average contribution, facilitating high-quality scene reconstruction. We further propose a region-based rendering technique to accelerate large scene rendering, which culls Gaussians invisible to the region where the viewpoint is located. Such a technique significantly speeds up the rendering without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on multiple large scenes show that our method achieves superior reconstruction results with faster rendering speed compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

在使用 3D 高斯散点 (3DGS) 进行大规模场景重建时，通常会将场景划分为多个较小的区域，并分别进行重建。然而，现有的划分方法忽略了遮挡信息，导致每个区域可能包含大量严重遮挡的区域。由于这些区域内的相机之间相关性较低，使得它们对整体重建的贡献度较低，进而影响最终的重建质量。
为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种基于遮挡感知的场景划分策略，该策略基于相机的位置和共视信息 (co-visibility) 进行聚类，从而生成多个子区域。在这些区域内，相机之间的相关性更强，平均贡献度更高，从而促进高质量的场景重建。
此外，我们进一步提出了一种基于区域的渲染技术，用于加速大规模场景的渲染。该方法能够剔除当前视角所在区域不可见的高斯点，从而在不影响渲染质量的前提下显著提升渲染速度。
在多个大规模场景上的实验表明，与现有最先进的方法相比，我们的方法能够实现更优的重建质量，同时显著提升渲染效率。
