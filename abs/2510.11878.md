### GS-Verse: Mesh-based Gaussian Splatting for Physics-aware Interaction in Virtual Reality

As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce GS-Verse (Gaussian Splatting for Virtual Environment Rendering and Scene Editing), a novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, GS-Verse facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow. Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

随着沉浸式3D内容需求的增长，对直观高效的交互方式的需求也日益迫切。目前在虚拟现实（VR）中进行3D内容物理操控的技术常常面临诸多限制，包括依赖高工程成本的流程，以及采用诸如四面体笼状结构等简化几何表示，这些都可能影响视觉真实感与物理准确性。本文提出GS-Verse（Gaussian Splatting for Virtual Environment Rendering and Scene Editing），一种新颖的方法，旨在通过将物体网格与高斯溅射（Gaussian Splatting, GS）表示直接融合，来克服上述挑战。我们的方法可实现更精确的表面近似，从而带来高度真实的变形效果与交互体验。通过利用现有的3D网格资产，GS-Verse支持无缝的内容复用，简化开发流程。此外，该系统在设计上不依赖具体的物理引擎，为开发者提供了强大的部署灵活性。这一通用架构为交互式3D操控提供了真实感强、适应性高、操作直观的新范式。我们通过一项涉及18位参与者的用户对比研究，严谨地将本方法与当前结合VR与GS的最先进技术进行比较验证。结果表明，我们的方法在感知物理性的拉伸操控方面具有统计显著优势，在扭转和抖动等其他物理操控任务中也表现出更高的一致性。在不同交互类型和场景中的进一步评估亦验证了本方法持续稳定的高性能，展现出其作为现有方法可行替代方案的潜力。
