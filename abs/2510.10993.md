### Perspective-aware 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Multi-view Consistency

3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work, we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views, PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.

三维高斯图像修复（3D Gaussian Inpainting）是虚拟现实与多媒体等众多应用中的关键技术，近年来借助预训练扩散模型取得了显著进展。然而，实现多视角一致性这一高质量修复所必需的核心要求，仍然面临重大挑战。为此，我们提出PAInpainter，一种利用透视感知内容传播与多视角一致性验证推进三维高斯修复的全新方法。该方法通过从透视图构建的视图图中自适应采样多个视角，迭代执行图像修复与三维高斯表示优化；同时，将修复图像作为先验信息进行传播，并对邻近视角之间的一致性进行验证，从而显著提升了三维场景修复的整体一致性与纹理真实感。大量实验验证了PAInpainter相较现有方法的优越性：在SPIn-NeRF与NeRFiller数据集上分别取得了26.03 dB与29.51 dB的PSNR成绩，充分展现了其有效性与泛化能力。
