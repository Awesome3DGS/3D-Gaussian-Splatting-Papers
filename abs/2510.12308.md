### Hybrid Gaussian Splatting for Novel Urban View Synthesis

This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place overall.

本文介绍了Qualcomm AI Research在ICCV 2025的RealADSim研讨会中所举办的RealADSim-NVS挑战赛中的解决方案。该挑战聚焦于街景场景下的新视图合成，要求参赛者基于若干训练轨迹中采集的车载视角图像，生成同一城市环境在不同轨迹（例如不同车道或车辆行驶方向）下的渲染结果。我们的解决方案受到混合式场景生成方法及融合高斯溅射与扩散模型的生成式模拟器的启发，整体由两个阶段组成：首先，对场景进行三维重建，并从目标视角渲染出新视图；随后，利用专用的单步扩散模型对渲染帧进行增强。我们详细讨论了高斯基元初始化、增强模型的微调策略以及训练数据的筛选方法。我们报告了该模型设计在新视图质量方面的性能表现，并通过PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标对各组件进行消融分析。在官方测试集排行榜上，我们的方法获得了总分0.432的成绩，排名第二。
