### ARGS: Advanced Regularization on Aligning Gaussians over the Surface

Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics. Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering, there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

从三维高斯点绘（3DGS）中重建高质量的三维网格和视觉效果，仍然是计算机图形学中的核心挑战。尽管现有模型（如 SuGaR）在渲染方面提供了有效的解决方案，但在视觉保真度和场景一致性方面仍有提升空间。本工作在 SuGaR 的基础上提出了两种互补的正则化策略，针对单个高斯形状和整体表面连贯性中的常见局限性进行改进。第一种策略是有效秩正则化，灵感来源于近期对高斯原语结构的研究。该正则化通过抑制极端的各向异性，尤其是“针状”形态，而更倾向于平衡的“盘状”形态，从而更适合稳定的表面重建。第二种策略是在优化过程中引入神经有符号距离函数（SDF）。SDF 结合 Eikonal 损失进行正则化，以保持合理的距离性质，并提供连续的全局表面先验，从而引导高斯更好地与潜在几何对齐。这两种正则化旨在同时提升单个高斯原语的保真度及其整体表面表现。最终模型能够从 3DGS 数据中生成更准确、更连贯的视觉效果。
