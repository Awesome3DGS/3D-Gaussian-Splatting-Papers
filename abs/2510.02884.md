### GS-Share: Enabling High-fidelity Map Sharing with Incremental Gaussian Splatting

Constructing and sharing 3D maps is essential for many applications, including autonomous driving and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction. However, a practical map-sharing system that features high-fidelity, continuous updates, and network efficiency remains elusive. To address these challenges, we introduce GS-Share, a photorealistic map-sharing system with a compact representation. The core of GS-Share includes anchor-based global map construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update. We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively. Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission overhead by 36%.

三维地图的构建与共享对于自动驾驶、增强现实等众多应用至关重要。近年来，三维高斯泼溅（3D Gaussian Splatting）作为一种精确的三维重建方法逐渐受到关注。然而，具备高保真度、持续更新能力与网络传输效率的实用地图共享系统仍未真正实现。为应对这些挑战，我们提出了 GS-Share——一个具有紧凑表示的真实感地图共享系统。GS-Share 的核心包括基于锚点的全局地图构建、基于虚拟图像的地图增强以及增量式地图更新机制。我们在与现有最先进方法的对比实验中表明，GS-Share 在重建保真度上（特别是在外推视角下）具有显著优势，PSNR、LPIPS 与 Depth L1 分别提升了 11%、22% 与 74%。此外，GS-Share 的表示也更加紧凑，地图传输开销减少了 36%。
