### EAvatar: Expression-Aware Head Avatar Reconstruction with Generative Geometry Priors

High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR, gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism, where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

高保真头部头像重建在 AR/VR、游戏和多媒体内容创作中发挥着关键作用。近年来，三维高斯喷溅（3DGS）在建模复杂几何结构并实现实时渲染方面展现了优越性，并被广泛应用于高保真头部头像重建任务。然而，现有基于 3DGS 的方法在捕捉细粒度面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面仍面临显著挑战，尤其是在高度可变形区域。为缓解这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于 3DGS 的头部重建框架 EAvatar，该框架同时具备表情感知和形变感知能力。我们的方法引入了稀疏表情控制机制，利用少量关键高斯影响其邻域高斯的形变，从而实现局部形变和细粒度纹理过渡的精确建模。此外，我们利用预训练生成模型提供的高质量三维先验，得到更可靠的面部几何，为训练过程提供结构性指导，从而提高收敛稳定性和形状精度。实验结果表明，我们的方法能够生成更准确且视觉一致的头部重建结果，并显著提升表情可控性和细节保真度。
