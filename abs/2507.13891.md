### PCR-GS: COLMAP-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting via Pose Co-Regularizations

COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and 3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

无 COLMAP 的三维高斯点渲染（3D-GS）因其在从无位姿图像或视频中重建高质量三维场景方面表现出色，近年来备受关注。然而，当场景包含复杂的相机轨迹时，例如相邻视角间存在剧烈的旋转和平移变化，该方法往往难以处理，导致相机位姿估计退化，并在相机位姿与 3D-GS 的联合优化中陷入局部最优。为此，我们提出了 PCR-GS，这是一种创新的无 COLMAP 3D-GS 技术，通过相机位姿协同正则化实现更优的三维场景建模与相机位姿估计。PCR-GS 从两个方面实现正则化：第一，特征重投影正则化，从相邻相机视角中提取具有视角鲁棒性的 DINO 特征，并对其语义信息进行对齐，从而实现相机位姿的正则化；第二，基于小波的频率正则化，利用高频细节的差异进一步优化相机位姿中的旋转矩阵。大量真实场景实验表明，所提出的 PCR-GS 在相机轨迹剧烈变化的情况下，能够实现更优的无位姿 3D-GS 场景建模效果。
