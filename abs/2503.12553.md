### Niagara: Normal-Integrated Geometric Affine Field for Scene Reconstruction from a Single View

Recent advances in single-view 3D scene reconstruction have highlighted the challenges in capturing fine geometric details and ensuring structural consistency, particularly in high-fidelity outdoor scene modeling. This paper presents Niagara, a new single-view 3D scene reconstruction framework that can faithfully reconstruct challenging outdoor scenes from a single input image for the first time.
Our approach integrates monocular depth and normal estimation as input, which substantially improves its ability to capture fine details, mitigating common issues like geometric detail loss and deformation.
Additionally, we introduce a geometric affine field (GAF) and 3D self-attention as geometry-constraint, which combines the structural properties of explicit geometry with the adaptability of implicit feature fields, striking a balance between efficient rendering and high-fidelity reconstruction.
Our framework finally proposes a specialized encoder-decoder architecture, where a depth-based 3D Gaussian decoder is proposed to predict 3D Gaussian parameters, which can be used for novel view synthesis. Extensive results and analyses suggest that our Niagara surpasses prior SoTA approaches such as Flash3D in both single-view and dual-view settings, significantly enhancing the geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, especially in outdoor scenes.

近年来，单视角三维场景重建的进展突显了捕捉细致几何细节和确保结构一致性方面的挑战，尤其是在高保真户外场景建模中。本文提出了Niagara，一种新的单视角三维场景重建框架，首次能够从单张输入图像中真实地重建具有挑战性的户外场景。
我们的方法将单眼深度和法线估计作为输入，显著提高了捕捉细节的能力，缓解了几何细节丧失和变形等常见问题。此外，我们引入了几何仿射场（GAF）和三维自注意力作为几何约束，这将显式几何的结构特性与隐式特征场的适应性结合，平衡了高效渲染与高保真重建之间的关系。
我们的框架最终提出了一种专门的编码器-解码器架构，其中提出了基于深度的三维高斯解码器，用于预测三维高斯参数，这些参数可以用于新颖视角合成。广泛的结果和分析表明，我们的Niagara在单视角和双视角设置中均优于先前的最先进方法，如Flash3D，显著提高了几何准确性和视觉保真度，特别是在户外场景中。
