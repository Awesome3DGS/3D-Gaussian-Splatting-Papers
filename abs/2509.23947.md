### CrashSplat: 2D to 3D Vehicle Damage Segmentation in Gaussian Splatting

Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage. Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical or impossible.

自动车辆损伤检测在汽车保险行业中一直是一个备受关注的研究方向，因为它能够实现更快速、精准且具成本效益的损伤评估。然而，目前的研究很少超越二维图像分析去利用三维重建方法，而三维重建有潜力提供更全面、更符合几何真实的损伤表征。此外，近年来基于三维表示的新视图合成（Novel View Synthesis, NVS）方法，特别是三维高斯溅射（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3D-GS），已经证明即使在有限视角下，也能生成精确且一致的三维重建结果。在本研究中，我们提出了一种自动化的车辆损伤检测流程，该流程通过二维掩膜的上升（up-lifting）实现三维损伤分割。此外，我们还提出了一种简单但高效的、无学习（learning-free）的单视角 3D-GS 分割方法。具体而言，我们利用通过运动结构（Structure from Motion, SfM）获取的相机参数，将高斯点投影到图像平面上。随后，结合深度与不透明度的正态分布模型，并借助 Z-buffer 算法进行筛选。实验表明，该方法在诸如车辆损伤检测等具有挑战性的场景中表现尤为出色，因为目标对象（如划痕、小凹陷）往往仅在单一视角下清晰可见，使得多视一致性方法在此类任务中难以应用甚至不可行。
