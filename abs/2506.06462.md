### Splat and Replace: 3D Reconstruction with Repetitive Elements

We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction, registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances. Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

我们利用三维场景中的重复元素来提升新视角合成效果。尽管神经辐射场（Neural Radiance Fields, NeRF）和三维高斯泼溅（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）极大提升了新视角合成的质量，但在训练视角覆盖不足的情况下，模型对未见区域和遮挡部分的渲染仍然效果不佳。
我们的核心观察是：现实环境中往往充满了重复元素。为此，我们提出利用这些重复结构来改善因覆盖不全或遮挡导致的低质量区域重建。具体而言，我们的方法首先对 3DGS 重建中的每个重复实例进行分割与配准，然后在各实例间共享信息。该方法在提升几何结构质量的同时，也考虑了不同实例之间的外观差异。
我们在多个包含典型重复元素的合成与真实场景中对该方法进行了验证，结果显示该方法能显著提升新视角合成的整体质量。
