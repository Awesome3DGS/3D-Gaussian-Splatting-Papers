### VG-Mapping: Variation-Aware 3D Gaussians for Online Semi-static Scene Mapping

Maintaining an up-to-date map that accurately reflects recent changes in the environment is crucial, especially for robots that repeatedly traverse the same space. Failing to promptly update the changed regions can degrade map quality, resulting in poor localization, inefficient operations, and even lost robots. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently seen widespread adoption in online map reconstruction due to its dense, differentiable, and photorealistic properties, yet accurately and efficiently updating the regions of change remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose VG-Mapping, a novel online 3DGS-based mapping system tailored for such semi-static scenes. Our approach introduces a hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with a TSDF-based voxel map to efficiently identify changed regions in a scene, along with a variation-aware density control strategy that inserts or deletes Gaussian primitives in regions undergoing change. Furthermore, to address the absence of public benchmarks for this task, we construct a RGB-D dataset comprising both synthetic and real-world semi-static environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves the rendering quality and map update efficiency in semi-static scenes.

维护一张能够准确反映环境最新变化的地图至关重要，尤其对于那些需反复穿越同一区域的机器人而言更是如此。如果未能及时更新发生变化的区域，地图质量将下降，导致定位误差、操作效率低下，甚至机器人丢失等严重问题。三维高斯泼溅（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）因其稠密、可微分及高度写实的特性，近年来被广泛应用于在线地图重建中，然而，如何高效且准确地更新变化区域仍然是一个挑战。本文提出VG-Mapping，一种专为半静态场景设计的在线3DGS地图构建系统。该方法引入一种混合表示，将3DGS与基于TSDF的体素地图相结合，以高效识别场景中发生变化的区域，并提出一种变化感知的密度控制策略，在变化区域中插入或删除高斯基元以实现动态更新。此外，鉴于该任务尚无公开基准，我们构建了一个涵盖合成与真实半静态环境的RGB-D数据集。实验结果表明，VG-Mapping在半静态场景中显著提升了渲染质量与地图更新效率。
