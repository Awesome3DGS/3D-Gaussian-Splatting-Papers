### SPAGS: Sparse-View Articulated Object Reconstruction from Single State via Planar Gaussian Splatting

Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily environments, and their 3D reconstruction holds great significance across various fields. However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data than existing methods.

关节物体在日常环境中无处不在，其三维重建在多个领域具有重要意义。然而，现有的关节物体重建方法通常依赖代价高昂的输入，如多阶段和多视角观测。为解决这一局限，我们提出了一种基于平面高斯溅射的类别无关关节物体重建框架，仅使用单一状态下的稀疏视角RGB图像。具体而言，我们首先引入高斯信息场，用于从候选相机姿态中感知最优的稀疏视角；随后将三维高斯压缩为平面高斯，以促进法线与深度的准确估计。平面高斯通过深度平滑正则项与少量扩散优化策略，以粗到细的方式进行优化。此外，我们为每个高斯基元引入部件分割概率，并通过反投影渲染结果的分割掩码对其进行更新。大量实验证明，我们的方法在合成数据与真实数据上均实现了更高保真的部件级表面重建，优于现有方法。
