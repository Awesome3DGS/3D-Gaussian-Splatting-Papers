### EmbodiedSplat: Personalized Real-to-Sim-to-Real Navigation with Gaussian Splats from a Mobile Device

The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

具身智能（Embodied AI）领域主要依赖仿真环境进行训练和评估，这些环境通常要么是缺乏真实感的全合成场景，要么是通过昂贵硬件捕获的高保真真实场景重建。因此，从仿真到现实（sim-to-real）的迁移仍然是一个主要挑战。本文提出了一种新方法——EmbodiedSplat，通过高效获取部署环境并在重建场景中微调策略，实现策略训练的个性化。我们的方法结合了三维高斯溅射（3D Gaussian Splatting，GS）与 Habitat-Sim 模拟器，在真实场景捕获与高效训练环境之间搭建桥梁。通过使用 iPhone 拍摄的部署场景，我们利用 GS 进行网格重建，使训练环境能够高度接近真实世界条件。我们对训练策略、预训练数据集和网格重建技术进行了系统分析，评估它们在真实场景中的仿真到现实预测性能上的影响。实验结果表明，经过 EmbodiedSplat 微调的智能体在真实世界的图像导航任务中，较在大规模真实数据集（HM3D）和合成数据集（HSSD）上预训练的零样本基线模型，分别实现了 20% 和 40% 的绝对成功率提升。此外，我们的方法在重建网格上的仿真与现实相关性达到 0.87–0.97，充分验证了其在以最小代价适应多样化环境中的有效性。
