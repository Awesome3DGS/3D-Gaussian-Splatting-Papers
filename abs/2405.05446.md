### GDGS: Gradient Domain Gaussian Splatting for Sparse Representation of Radiance Fields

The 3D Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, they work directly on the signal, leading to a dense representation of the signal. Even with some techniques such as pruning or distillation, the results are still dense. In this paper, we propose to model the gradient of the original signal. The gradients are much sparser than the original signal. Therefore, the gradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage and thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering. Thanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels are needed, leading to much higher computational performance (100∼1000× faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via solving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity. Several experiments are performed to confirm the sparseness of the gradients and the computation performance of the proposed method. The method can be applied various applications, such as human body modeling and indoor environment modeling.

三维高斯喷溅方法正变得越来越流行。然而，它们直接作用于信号上，导致信号表示较为密集。尽管采用了剪枝或蒸馏等技术，结果仍然是密集的。在本文中，我们提议建模原始信号的梯度。梯度比原始信号稀疏得多。因此，梯度使用的高斯喷溅数量少得多，导致更有效的存储，从而在训练和渲染期间具有更高的计算性能。由于稀疏性，在视图合成期间只需要少量像素，从而大大提高了计算性能（快100～1000倍）。通过求解具有线性计算复杂性的泊松方程，可以从梯度中恢复2D图像。进行了几项实验以确认梯度的稀疏性和所提方法的计算性能。该方法可以应用于各种应用，例如人体建模和室内环境建模。
