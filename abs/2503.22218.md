### ABC-GS: Alignment-Based Controllable Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D scene stylization approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve promising results by optimizing with Nearest Neighbor Feature Matching (NNFM) loss. However, NNFM loss does not consider global style information. In addition, the implicit representation of NeRF limits their fine-grained control over the resulting scenes. In this paper, we introduce ABC-GS, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D style transfer. To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms. Extensive experiments show that our ABC-GS provides controllability of style transfer and achieves stylization results that are more faithfully aligned with the global style of the chosen artistic reference.

基于神经辐射场（Neural Radiance Fields, NeRF）的三维场景风格化方法通过采用最近邻特征匹配（Nearest Neighbor Feature Matching, NNFM）损失实现了令人瞩目的效果。然而，NNFM损失未能考虑整体风格信息，且NeRF的隐式表示方式限制了对生成场景的精细控制。
本文提出了一种新的三维高斯泼洒（3D Gaussian Splatting）框架——ABC-GS，以实现高质量的三维风格迁移。为此，我们设计了一个可控的匹配阶段，通过分割掩码实现场景内容与风格特征之间的精确对齐。此外，提出了一种基于特征对齐的风格迁移损失函数，确保迁移结果准确地反映参考图像的整体风格。为了保持场景的原始几何信息，我们引入了深度损失和高斯正则化项。
大量实验表明，ABC-GS在风格迁移过程中具有良好的可控性，并且能够更忠实地对齐参考艺术作品的整体风格，生成高质量的风格化结果。
