### PyGS: Large-scale Scene Representation with Pyramidal 3D Gaussian Splatting

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthesizing photorealistic images of large-scale scenes. However, they are often plagued by a loss of fine details and long rendering durations. 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently been introduced as a potent alternative, achieving both high-fidelity visual results and accelerated rendering performance. Nonetheless, scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting is fraught with challenges. Specifically, large-scale scenes grapples with the integration of objects across multiple scales and disparate viewpoints, which often leads to compromised efficacy as the Gaussians need to balance between detail levels. Furthermore, the generation of initialization points via COLMAP from large-scale dataset is both computationally demanding and prone to incomplete reconstructions. To address these challenges, we present Pyramidal 3D Gaussian Splatting (PyGS) with NeRF Initialization. Our approach represent the scene with a hierarchical assembly of Gaussians arranged in a pyramidal fashion. The top level of the pyramid is composed of a few large Gaussians, while each subsequent layer accommodates a denser collection of smaller Gaussians. We effectively initialize these pyramidal Gaussians through sampling a rapidly trained grid-based NeRF at various frequencies. We group these pyramidal Gaussians into clusters and use a compact weighting network to dynamically determine the influence of each pyramid level of each cluster considering camera viewpoint during rendering. Our method achieves a significant performance leap across multiple large-scale datasets and attains a rendering time that is over 400 times faster than current state-of-the-art approaches.

神经辐射场（NeRF）在合成大规模场景的逼真图像方面表现出了卓越的能力。然而，它们常常受到细节丢失和长时间渲染的困扰。最近引入的三维高斯喷溅作为一种强大的替代方案，实现了高保真的视觉效果和加速的渲染性能。尽管如此，扩展三维高斯喷溅面临着挑战。特别是，大规模场景需要处理多个尺度和不同视角的对象整合，这常常导致效能受损，因为高斯需要在细节水平之间取得平衡。此外，通过COLMAP从大规模数据集生成初始化点既计算要求高，又容易导致重建不完整。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了具有NeRF初始化的金字塔式三维高斯喷溅（PyGS）。我们的方法使用金字塔式排列的高斯层次结构来表示场景。金字塔的顶层由少量大高斯组成，而每个后续层包含更密集的小高斯集合。我们通过在不同频率上采样一个快速训练的基于网格的NeRF有效地初始化这些金字塔高斯。我们将这些金字塔高斯聚集成簇，并使用一个紧凑的加权网络在渲染过程中动态确定每个簇的每个金字塔层次的影响，考虑到相机视角。我们的方法在多个大规模数据集上取得了显著的性能飞跃，并实现了比当前最先进方法快400多倍的渲染时间。
