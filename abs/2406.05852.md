### RefGaussian: Disentangling Reflections from 3D Gaussian Splatting for Realistic Rendering

3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made a notable advancement in the field of neural rendering, 3D scene reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Nevertheless, 3D-GS encounters the main challenge when it comes to accurately representing physical reflections, especially in the case of total reflection and semi-reflection that are commonly found in real-world scenes. This limitation causes reflections to be mistakenly treated as independent elements with physical presence, leading to imprecise reconstructions. Herein, to tackle this challenge, we propose RefGaussian to disentangle reflections from 3D-GS for realistically modeling reflections. Specifically, we propose to split a scene into transmitted and reflected components and represent these components using two Spherical Harmonics (SH). Given that this decomposition is not fully determined, we employ local regularization techniques to ensure local smoothness for both the transmitted and reflected components, thereby achieving more plausible decomposition outcomes than 3D-GS. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior novel view synthesis and accurate depth estimation outcomes. Furthermore, it enables the utilization of scene editing applications, ensuring both high-quality results and physical coherence.

3D高斯涂抹（3D-GS）在神经渲染、3D场景重建和新视角合成领域取得了显著进展。然而，当涉及到精确表示物理反射时，特别是在现实世界场景中常见的全反射和半反射情况下，3D-GS面临主要挑战。这一限制导致反射被错误地视为具有物理存在的独立元素，从而导致重建不精确。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了RefGaussian方法，以从3D-GS中分离反射，实现现实地模拟反射。具体来说，我们提议将场景分为传输和反射两个部分，并使用两个球谐（SH）来表示这些部分。鉴于这种分解并不完全确定，我们采用局部正则化技术确保传输和反射部分的局部平滑性，从而实现比3D-GS更可信的分解结果。实验结果表明，我们的方法在新视角合成和精确深度估计方面实现了优越的成果。此外，它还使得场景编辑应用成为可能，确保了高质量的结果和物理一致性。
