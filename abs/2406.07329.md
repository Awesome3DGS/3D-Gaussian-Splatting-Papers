### Cinematic Gaussians: Real-Time HDR Radiance Fields with Depth of Field

Radiance field methods represent the state of the art in reconstructing complex scenes from multi-view photos. However, these reconstructions often suffer from one or both of the following limitations: First, they typically represent scenes in low dynamic range (LDR), which restricts their use to evenly lit environments and hinders immersive viewing experiences. Secondly, their reliance on a pinhole camera model, assuming all scene elements are in focus in the input images, presents practical challenges and complicates refocusing during novel-view synthesis. Addressing these limitations, we present a lightweight method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes multi-view LDR images of a scene with varying exposure times, apertures, and focus distances as input to reconstruct a high-dynamic-range (HDR) radiance field. By incorporating analytical convolutions of Gaussians based on a thin-lens camera model as well as a tonemapping module, our reconstructions enable the rendering of HDR content with flexible refocusing capabilities. We demonstrate that our combined treatment of HDR and depth of field facilitates real-time cinematic rendering, outperforming the state of the art.

辐射场方法代表了从多视图照片重构复杂场景的最新技术。然而，这些重构通常会遇到以下一种或两种限制：首先，它们通常以低动态范围（LDR）来表示场景，这限制了它们在均匀照明环境中的使用，并妨碍了沉浸式观看体验。其次，它们依赖于针孔相机模型，假设所有场景元素在输入图像中都处于焦点状态，这在实践中带来了挑战，并且在新视角合成期间复焦变得复杂。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种基于3D高斯喷溅的轻量级方法，该方法使用具有不同曝光时间、光圈和焦点距离的多视图LDR图像作为输入，以重构高动态范围（HDR）光辉场。通过结合基于薄镜头相机模型的高斯的分析卷积以及色调映射模块，我们的重构使得HDR内容的渲染具有灵活的复焦能力。我们展示了我们对HDR和景深的综合处理，可以实现实时电影渲染，超越了现有技术水平。
