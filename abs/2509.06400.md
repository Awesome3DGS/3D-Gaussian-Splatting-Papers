### 3DOF+Quantization: 3DGS quantization for large scenes with limited Degrees of Freedom

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes, though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as 3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden scene.

三维高斯溅射（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）是三维场景重建领域的一项重大突破。给定某个物体或场景的多视角图像，该算法通过训练由三维高斯组成的模型，从而能够从任意视点生成新视角图像。这种自由的视角变化被称为“6自由度”（6DoF），即视图可以根据任意位置（3个自由度）和相机朝向（另3个自由度）进行生成。然而，在大规模场景中，输入视图通常来自空间中的有限区域，因此重建结果仅在该区域内生成的新视角具有实际价值，即使整个场景的空间范围几乎是无限的。我们将这种特定情形称为“3DoF+”，表示相机位置的三个自由度仅限于围绕中心位置的小范围偏移。本文研究了坐标量化（coordinate quantization）问题，分析了位置误差对像素投影误差的影响。研究表明，投影误差与被投影点距离的平方反比成正比。基于此，我们提出了一种基于球坐标系的新型量化方案。最后，我们在著名的“Garden”场景上展示了该方法的率失真（rate-distortion）性能表现。
