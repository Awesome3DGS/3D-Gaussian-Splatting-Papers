### Sort-free Gaussian Splatting via Weighted Sum Rendering

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a significant advancement in 3D scene reconstruction, attracting considerable attention due to its ability to recover high-fidelity details while maintaining low complexity. Despite the promising results achieved by 3DGS, its rendering performance is constrained by its dependence on costly non-commutative alpha-blending operations. These operations mandate complex view dependent sorting operations that introduce computational overhead, especially on the resource-constrained platforms such as mobile phones. In this paper, we propose Weighted Sum Rendering, which approximates alpha blending with weighted sums, thereby removing the need for sorting. This simplifies implementation, delivers superior performance, and eliminates the "popping" artifacts caused by sorting. Experimental results show that optimizing a generalized Gaussian splatting formulation to the new differentiable rendering yields competitive image quality. The method was implemented and tested in a mobile device GPU, achieving on average 1.23× faster rendering.

最近，三维高斯喷涂 (3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS) 在三维场景重建方面取得了显著进展，因其能够在保持低复杂度的同时恢复高保真细节而备受关注。尽管 3DGS 取得了有前景的结果，其渲染性能受到依赖于昂贵的非交换性 alpha 混合操作的限制。这些操作要求复杂的视角相关排序操作，尤其在移动设备等资源受限的平台上引入了计算开销。本文提出了加权求和渲染，通过加权求和来近似 alpha 混合，从而消除排序需求。这一方法简化了实现过程，提升了性能，并消除了因排序引起的“跳跃”伪影。实验结果表明，将通用的高斯喷涂公式优化至新的可微分渲染形式能够实现具有竞争力的图像质量。该方法在移动设备 GPU 上实现并测试，平均渲染速度提升了 1.23 倍。
