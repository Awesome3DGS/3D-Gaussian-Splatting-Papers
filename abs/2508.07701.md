### Multi-view Normal and Distance Guidance Gaussian Splatting for Surface Reconstruction

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction capability of 3DGS.

三维高斯溅射（3DGS）在表面重建领域取得了显著成果。然而，当高斯法向量在单视图投影平面内对齐时，尽管几何在当前视角下看似合理，但在切换到相邻视角时可能会产生偏差。为了解决多视图场景中的距离与全局匹配问题，我们设计了多视图法向与距离引导的高斯溅射方法。该方法通过约束相邻深度图并对齐三维法向，实现几何深度统一与高精度重建。具体而言，对于小规模室内外场景的重建，我们提出了多视图距离重投影正则化模块，通过计算两个相邻视角与同一高斯表面之间的距离损失，实现多视图高斯对齐。此外，我们开发了多视图法向增强模块，通过匹配相邻视角中像素点的法向并计算损失，从而保证跨视角一致性。大量实验结果表明，我们的方法在定量与定性评估中均优于基线方法，显著提升了3DGS的表面重建能力。
