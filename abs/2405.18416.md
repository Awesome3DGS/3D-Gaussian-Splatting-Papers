### 3D StreetUnveiler with Semantic-Aware 2DGS

Unveiling an empty street from crowded observations captured by in-car cameras is crucial for autonomous driving. However, removing all temporary static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on thorough observation in a small scene, street scenes involve long trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street. StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed, partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further applications.

为自动驾驶揭示由车载摄像头捕获的拥挤观测中的空荡街道至关重要。然而，移除所有临时静止对象，如停车的车辆和站立的行人，呈现出显著的挑战。与依赖于小场景中彻底观察的以对象为中心的3D补画不同，街景涉及的是长轨迹，这与以往的3D补画任务不同。由于对象观察的限度和时间持续性，摄像头为中心的移动环境进一步复杂化了这一任务。为了解决这些障碍，我们推出了 StreetUnveiler 来重建一个空荡的街道。StreetUnveiler 学习了从拥挤观测中得到的空荡街道的3D表征。我们的表征基于硬标签语义的二维高斯喷溅（2DGS），因其可扩展性和识别需要移除的高斯的能力。我们在移除不需要的高斯后补画渲染图像，提供伪标签并随后重新优化2DGS。鉴于其时间上的连续运动，我们将空荡街道场景划分为已观察区域、部分观察区域和未观察区域，我们建议通过渲染的透明度图来定位这些区域。这种分解帮助我们最小化需要补画的区域。为了增强补画的时间一致性，我们引入了一种新颖的时间反转框架，以逆序补画帧，并使用后续帧作为早期帧的参考，以充分利用长轨迹观测。我们在街道场景数据集上进行的实验成功重建了空荡街道的3D表征。可以提取空荡街道的网格表征以供进一步应用。
