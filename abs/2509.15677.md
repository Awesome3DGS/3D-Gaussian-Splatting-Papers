### Camera Splatting for Continuous View Optimization

We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats. View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting. Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena, including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

本文提出了 **Camera Splatting**，一种用于新视图合成的全新视图优化框架。该方法将每个相机建模为一个三维高斯分布（即“相机溅射”），并在靠近表面的三维点上放置虚拟相机（称为“点相机”），用于观测相机溅射的分布。视图优化过程通过对这些相机溅射进行连续且可微分的优化，使得点相机所观测到的目标分布逐渐接近理想状态，这一过程与原始三维高斯溅射方法的思想相似。与“最远视图采样”（Farthest View Sampling, FVS）方法相比，我们的优化视图在捕捉复杂的视角相关现象（如强烈的金属反射和精细的纹理细节，如文字）方面表现出显著优势。
