### Thermal3D-GS: Physics-induced 3D Gaussians for Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis

Novel-view synthesis based on visible light has been extensively studied. In comparison to visible light imaging, thermal infrared imaging offers the advantage of all-weather imaging and strong penetration, providing increased possibilities for reconstruction in nighttime and adverse weather scenarios. However, thermal infrared imaging is influenced by physical characteristics such as atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction, hindering the precise reconstruction of intricate details in thermal infrared scenes, manifesting as issues of floaters and indistinct edge features in synthesized images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a physics-induced 3D Gaussian splatting method named Thermal3D-GS. Thermal3D-GS begins by modeling atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction in three-dimensional media using neural networks. Additionally, a temperature consistency constraint is incorporated into the optimization objective to enhance the reconstruction accuracy of thermal infrared images. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our method, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for this field named Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset (TI-NSD) is created. This dataset comprises 20 authentic thermal infrared video scenes, covering indoor, outdoor, and UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) scenarios, totaling 6,664 frames of thermal infrared image data. Based on this dataset, this paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of Thermal3D-GS. The results indicate that our method outperforms the baseline method with a 3.03 dB improvement in PSNR and significantly addresses the issues of floaters and indistinct edge features present in the baseline method.

基于可见光的新视图合成已被广泛研究。相比于可见光成像，热红外成像具备全天候成像和强穿透力的优势，能够在夜间和恶劣天气条件下提供更多的重建可能性。然而，热红外成像受到大气传输效应和热传导等物理特性的影响，难以精准重建热红外场景中的细节，表现为合成图像中的浮动伪影和边缘特征模糊等问题。为了解决这些局限性，本文提出了一种名为 Thermal3D-GS 的物理驱动3D高斯散点方法。Thermal3D-GS 首先通过神经网络对三维介质中的大气传输效应和热传导进行建模。此外，还将温度一致性约束引入到优化目标中，以提高热红外图像的重建精度。
为了验证该方法的有效性，本文创建了该领域首个大规模基准数据集，名为 Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset (TI-NSD)。该数据集包含20个真实的热红外视频场景，涵盖室内、室外以及无人机（UAV）场景，总计包含6,664帧热红外图像数据。基于该数据集，本文通过实验验证了 Thermal3D-GS 的有效性。结果表明，我们的方法在PSNR上较基线方法提升了3.03 dB，并显著解决了基线方法中存在的浮动伪影和边缘模糊问题。
