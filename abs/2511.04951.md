### CLM: Removing the GPU Memory Barrier for 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However, scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining, and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation. Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

三维高斯投影（3D Gaussian Splatting, 3DGS）因其渲染速度快、输出质量高，近年来在新视角合成任务中日益受到关注。然而，将3DGS扩展到大型或复杂场景面临显著挑战，主要原因在于其对内存的需求极高，超出了大多数GPU的内存容量。本文提出了CLM系统，使得3DGS可以在一块消费级GPU（如RTX4090）上渲染大规模场景。该系统通过将高斯数据卸载至CPU内存，仅在需要时再加载至GPU，从而规避了GPU内存瓶颈。为减少性能与通信开销，CLM设计了一种新颖的卸载策略，基于对3DGS内存访问模式的观察进行流水线处理，从而实现GPU到CPU通信、GPU计算与CPU计算的并行化。此外，我们还进一步利用访问模式特性，降低了通信数据量。评估结果表明，该实现能够在单块RTX4090上渲染一个包含1亿个高斯的大型场景，同时达到当前最先进的重建质量。
