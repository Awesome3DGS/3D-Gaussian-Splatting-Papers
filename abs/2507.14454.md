### Adaptive 3D Gaussian Splatting Video Streaming: Visual Saliency-Aware Tiling and Meta-Learning-Based Bitrate Adaptation

3D Gaussian splatting video (3DGS) streaming has recently emerged as a research hotspot in both academia and industry, owing to its impressive ability to deliver immersive 3D video experiences. However, research in this area is still in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling, quality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of solutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by saliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each tile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and multiple quality levels for adaptive selection. We also introduce a novel quality assessment framework for 3DGS video that jointly evaluates spatial-domain degradation in 3DGS representations during streaming and the quality of the resulting 2D rendered images. Additionally, we develop a meta-learning-based adaptive bitrate algorithm specifically tailored for 3DGS video streaming, achieving optimal performance across varying network conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

三维高斯点渲染视频（3DGS）流媒体因其在呈现沉浸式三维视频体验方面的卓越能力，近年来已成为学术界和工业界的研究热点。然而，该领域研究仍处于早期阶段，切片、质量评估和码率自适应等若干基础性问题亟需深入探索。本文针对这些挑战提出了一整套综合性解决方案。具体而言，我们提出了一种基于显著性分析的自适应 3DGS 切片技术，融合了空间和时间特征；每个切片被编码为具备专用形变场和多种质量等级的版本，以供自适应选择。我们还引入了一种新颖的 3DGS 视频质量评估框架，联合评估流媒体传输过程中 3DGS 表示的空间域退化及其渲染生成的二维图像质量。此外，我们设计了一种基于元学习的 3DGS 视频流媒体码率自适应算法，能够在不同网络条件下实现最优性能。大量实验结果表明，所提出的方法在多个方面均显著优于当前最先进的方法。
