### Reconstruction and Reenactment Separated Method for Realistic Gaussian Head

In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

本文提出了一种重建与驱动分离的三维高斯人头生成框架，该方法仅需输入一张人像图像即可生成可控虚拟头像。具体而言，我们基于WebSSL构建了一个大规模单次生成（one-shot）的高斯人头生成器，并采用了两阶段训练策略，从而显著提升了模型的泛化能力与高频纹理重建效果。在推理阶段，一个由控制信号驱动的超轻量级高斯头像模型实现了高帧率渲染，在512×512分辨率下可达90帧每秒（FPS）。进一步实验表明，所提出的框架遵循“缩放定律”（scaling law）：当重建模块的参数规模增加时，模型性能也随之提升。此外，得益于重建与驱动的分离设计，驱动阶段的效率不受影响。最后，大量定量与定性实验验证了我们的方法在性能上全面优于当前最先进的技术。
