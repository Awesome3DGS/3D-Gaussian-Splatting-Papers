### iLRM: An Iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model

Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger number of input views.

前馈式三维建模已成为实现快速、高质量三维重建的有前景方法。尤其是直接生成显式三维表示（如三维高斯溅射）因其快速且高质量的渲染能力以及广泛的应用场景而备受关注。然而，许多主要基于 Transformer 架构的最新方法存在严重的可扩展性问题，因为它们依赖跨多个输入视角图像 token 的全局注意力机制，随着视角数量或图像分辨率的增加，其计算成本会急剧上升。为实现可扩展且高效的前馈式三维重建，我们提出了一种迭代式大型三维重建模型（iLRM），通过迭代细化机制生成三维高斯表示，并遵循三项核心原则：（1）将场景表示与输入视角图像解耦，以实现紧凑的三维表示；（2）将全注意力的多视图交互分解为两阶段注意力方案，以降低计算成本；（3）在每一层引入高分辨率信息，以实现高保真重建。在 RE10K 和 DL3DV 等广泛使用的数据集上的实验结果表明，iLRM 在重建质量和速度上均优于现有方法。值得注意的是，iLRM 具有卓越的可扩展性，在相当的计算成本下，通过高效利用更多输入视角，显著提升了重建质量。
